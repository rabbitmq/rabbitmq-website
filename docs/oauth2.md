# OAuth 2.0 Authentication Backend

## Overview {#overview}

This [RabbitMQ authentication/authorisation backend](./access-control) plugin lets applications
(clients) and users authenticate and authorize using JWT-encoded OAuth 2.0 access tokens.

There's also a companion [troubleshooting guide for OAuth 2-specific problems](./troubleshooting-oauth2).

## How to configure it {#how-to-configure-it}

This is a step-by-step guide for how to configure OAuth 2.0 authentication for the majority of
use-cases, such as:

- You are using an identity provider that is compliant with OpenId Connect
- You want RabbitMQ to trigger OAuth 2.0 authentication in the management UI. This is known as
  *Service Provider initiated logon*. This is different from users needing to come to RabbitMQ
  already with a token already obtained by other means.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

#### Step 1: Enable the plugin

The OAuth 2 plugin must be activated (or [pre-configured](./plugins#enabled-plugins-file)) before it
can be used, like all other plugins. There is a file commonly found at
`/etc/rabbitmq/enabled_plugins`. Add the OAuth 2 plugin as follows:

```bash
[rabbitmq_management,rabbitmq_shovel,rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2].
```

#### Step 2: Configure OAuth 2.0 as one of the authentication backends

Edit your `rabbitmq.conf` file, commonly found at `/etc/rabbitmq`, and add OAuth 2.0 backend. For
example, the following configuration adds OAuth 2.0 as the only authentication backend:

```ini
auth_backends.1 = rabbit_auth_backend_oauth2
```

### Configure OAuth 2.0 step by step {#configure-for-openid-connect}

Nowadays, the majority of the identity providers are compliant with OpenId Connect. At minimum,
this means that they expose an HTTP endpoint called *Discovery endpoint* mounted at
`/.well-known/openid-configuration`. Through this endpoint, RabbitMQ discovers all the necessary
endpoints for a successful OAuth 2.0 authentication. The following identity providers are compliant
with OpenId Connect:

- UAA
- Keycloak
- Auth0
- Entra ID (a.k.a Azure)
- Okta

#### Step 1: Configure the OAuth 2.0 resource name associated to RabbitMQ {#step1}

```ìni
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq
```

:::warning
OAuth 2.0 tokens have an attribute called `audience`. This attribute lists all the OAuth 2.0
resources the token is meant for. RabbitMQ expects to find its `resource_server_id` in one of the
`audience` values. If it is not found, the token is rejected and the authentication fails.

Although it is not recommended, you can disable audience validation by adding the following
configuration:

```ini
auth_oauth2.verify_aud = false
```

:::

#### Step 2: Configure the root URL of the Identity Provider {#step2}

Configure the root URL of the identity provider as follows:

```ini
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://keycloak:8443/realms/test
```

:::info
It must be an HTTPS URL. If your identity provider uses a certificate signed by a self-signed CA
certificate, you can configure the CA certificate by adding the following line to your configuration:

```ini
auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile = <path_to_your_ca_cert>
```

:::

#### Step 3: Configure which token's attributes contain the username {#step3}

RabbitMQ needs to know the user name for logging purposes and also to display it in the management
UI. By default, RabbitMQ looks up the user name in the token's attribute `sub`, and if not found it
uses `client_id`.

Here you are configuring RabbitMQ to use `user_name` first and, if not found, `preferred_username`
instead.

```ini
auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims.1 = user_name
auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims.2 = preferred_username
```

#### Step 4: Configure which token's attribute contains the scopes (a.k.a. permissions) {#step4}

By default, RabbitMQ always looks for scopes in the token's attribute `scope`. If your scopes
are in a different attribute you can configure the name of that attribute.

Given the following configuration, RabbitMQ searches for scopes in the attributes `scope` and
`extra_scope`:

```ini
auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key = extra_scope
```

The attribute's value can be a string of space-separated scopes or a JSON list of scopes.

Since 4.1, you can configure a space-separated list of tokens' attributes. Example token:

```json
{
  ...
  "authorization": {
    "permissions": [
      {
        "scopes": [
          "rabbitmq.read:*/*"
        ],
        "rsid": "2c390fe4-02ad-41c7-98a2-cebb8c60ccf1",
        "rsname": "allvhost"
      },
      {
        "scopes": [
          "rabbitmq.write:vhost1/*"
        ],
        "rsid": "e7f12e94-4c34-43d8-b2b1-c516af644cee",
        "rsname": "vhost1"
      },
      {
        "scopes": [
          "rabbitmq.tag:administrator"
        ],
        "rsid": "12ac3d1c-28c2-4521-8e33-0952eff10bd9"
      }
    ]
  },
  "resource_access": {
    "account": {
      "roles": [
        "manage-account",
        "manage-account-links",
        "view-profile"
      ]
    }
  },
  "scope": "email profile openid",
  "extra_scope": "rabbitmq.tag:administrator rabbitmq.tag:management",
  ...
}
```

You can configure RabbitMQ to get scopes from underneath `authorization.permissions.scopes`,
and from `resource_access.account.roles` and `extra_scope` as follows:

```ini
auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key = extra_scope realm_access.roles resource_access.account.roles
```

:::warning
Take into account that the scopes in `resource_access.account.roles` are not RabbitMQ-recognized
scopes. If you want to use those roles as RabbitMQ scopes, you have to map them. See [steps 5)](#step5)
and [6)](#step6).
:::

#### Step 5: Ensure your scopes are recognized RabbitMQ scopes {#step5}

Ensure that the scopes contained in the token are [recognized RabbitMQ scopes](#scope-translation).

Here are examples of recognized RabbitMQ scopes:

* `rabbitmq.tag:administrator` Here `rabbitmq` is the name of the `resource_server_id` you
  configured in the first step. `tag:administrator` grants administrator role to the management UI.

* `rabbitmq.configure:*/*` This scope grants `configure` permission. The first wildcard corresponds
  to the vhost and the second wildcard to the queue/exchange.

They all start with a prefix which, by default, must match the name of the resource you configured
in step 1.

If your scopes are recognized RabbitMQ scopes, however, they start with a different prefix. You can
configure your custom prefix as follows:

```ini
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = api://
```

In the above example, you are saying that your scopes are like `api://tag:administrator`.

:::info
More information about scope prefix, check out [Scope Prefix](#scope-prefix).
:::

#### Step 6: Map custom permissions/scopes onto RabbitMQ scopes {#step6}

This step is mandatory if the scopes in the token are not recognized RabbitMQ scopes. In the
previous step you saw what recognized RabbitMQ scopes look like.

Here you are configuring two custom scopes, `admin` and `developer`, on to RabbitMQ scopes:

```ini
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.admin = rabbitmq.tag:administrator rabbitmq.read:*/
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.developer = rabbitmq.tag:management rabbitmq.read:*/* rabbitmq.write:*/* rabbitmq.configure:*/*
```

:::info
For more information mapping scopes check out [Scope Aliases](#scope-aliases).
:::

#### Step 7: OAuth 2.0 authentication completed for messaging protocols {#step7}

RabbitMQ is ready to authenticate applications connecting via one of the supported messaging
protocols. If you additionally want to enable OAuth 2.0 in the management UI carry on with following
steps.

#### Step 8: Enable OAuth 2.0 on the management UI {#step8}

The following steps configure RabbitMQ to use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users with their identity
provider and get a token. This is known as
[Service provider initiated logon](oauth2-examples#service-provider-initiated-logon).

```ini
management.oauth_enabled = true
```

:::info
After you enable OAuth 2.0 in the management UI,
basic authentication is disabled unless you add the following configuration.

```ini
management.oauth_disable_basic_auth = false
```

For more information, checkout [Allow Basic and OAuth 2 authentication for management UI](management#allow-basic-auth-for-mgt-ui)
:::

#### Step 9: Configure OAuth client_id

```ini
management.oauth_client_id = <Your_Client_Id_from_your_identity_provider>
```

:::warning
The identity provider `UAA` requires a `client_secret` in addition to a `client_id`.
This is not necessary in the rest of the identity providers. The OAuth Client configured
for RabbitMQ in your identity provider should be of type `public web application` and
not `confidential`. The latter requires `client_secret`.
:::

#### Step 10: Configure which scopes the management UI requests from your identity provider {#step10}

When RabbitMQ requests a token from the identity provider, it has to specify which scopes should
contain the token. Through the configuration variable `management.oauth_scopes` you provide a
space-separated list of scopes.

You always include the first two scopes `openid` and `profile` followed by any RabbitMQ scope.

```ini
management.oauth_scopes = openid profile rabbitmq.tag:management
```

:::info
Some identity providers may include more scopes than the requested scopes. It will all
depend on the actual identity provider implementation.
:::

## How it works {#how-it-works}

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To use the OAuth 2 plugin, all RabbitMQ nodes must be

1. [Configured to use the rabbit_auth_backend_oauth2 backend](./access-control).
2. [Configured with the resource service ID](#resource-server-id) (`resource_server_id`). The
   RabbitMQ cluster becomes an OAuth 2.0 resource and this is its identifier.
3. [Configured with issuer URL](#configure-issuer) of the OAuth 2.0 provider, or the JWKS URL, or
   directly with the signing keys that the OAuth 2.0 provider uses to sign tokens

Here is the minimal configuration to support OAuth 2.0 authentication:

:::info
To activate it in the Management plugin you need [additional configuration](./management#minimum-configuration).
:::

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = new_resource_server_id
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://my-oauth2-provider.com/realm/rabbitmq
```

Based on the previous configuration, JWT Tokens presented to RabbitMQ for authentication must:

- Be digitally signed.
- Have a value in the `aud` field that matches `resource_server_id` value.
- Have scopes that must match the `resource_server_id` value. For example `new_resource_server_id.read:*/*`.

Also, the `https://my-oauth2-provider.com/realm/rabbitmq/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint
must return the OpenID Provider Configuration, which includes the JKWS URL to download the signing
keys.

:::info
*.well-known/openid-configuration* is the OpenID standard path for the OpenID Provider Configuration endpoint
:::

If your provider exposes a different path and/or requires some extra http parameters for the OpenId
discovery endpoint, you can configure them as follows:

```ini
auth_oauth2.discovery_endpoint_path = my/custom/path
auth_oauth2.discovery_endpoint_params.appid = some-app-id
```

More detail is included in the next section about what happens during the authentication and how to
configure OAuth 2.0 beyond the basic configuration shown previously.

## Authorization Flow {#authorization-flow}

This plugin does not communicate with any OAuth 2.0 provider in order to authenticate user and
grants access. Instead, it decodes an access token provided by the client and authorizes a user
based on the scopes found in the token.

Tokens must be digitally signed otherwise they are not accepted. RabbitMQ must have the signing key
to validate the signature. You can either configure the signing keys the OAuth 2.0 provider will
use, or configure RabbitMQ with one of the following two endpoints:

* **JWKS endpoint**: this is the HTTP endpoint that returns the signing keys used to digitally sign
  the tokens

* **OpenID Provider Configuration endpoint**: this endpoint returns the provider's configuration
  including all of its endpoints, most importantly the **JWKS endpoint**

When you configure RabbitMQ with one of two previous endpoints, RabbitMQ must make a HTTP request
(or two, if you specify the latter endpoint) to download the signing keys. This is an operation that
occurs once for any signing key not downloaded yet. When the OAuth 2.0 provider rotates the signing
keys, newer tokens refer to a new signing key which RabbitMQ does not have yet which triggers
another download of the newer signing keys.

The token can be any [JWT token](https://jwt.io/introduction/) which contains the `scope` and `aud`
fields.

In chronological order, here is the sequence of events that occur when a client application wants to
connect to one of the RabbitMQ's messaging protocols, such as AMQP:

1. The Client application requests an **access_token** from the OAuth 2.0 provider.
2. The **access token** must include **scopes** supported by RabbitMQ in the `scope` field (it is
   possible to use a different field for the **scopes** by setting the name of the new field in
   `auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key`).
3. The Client application passes the token as password when connecting to RabbitMQ's messaging
   protocol. **The username field is ignored**.
4. RabbitMQ validates the token's signature. To validate it, RabbitMQ must have the signing keys or
   download them from the JWKS endpoint as explained in earlier sections.
5. RabbitMQ validates that the token has the **audience** claim and whose value matches the
   `resource_server_id` (this operation can be deactivated by setting `auth_oauth2.verify_aud` to
   `false`).
6. RabbitMQ translates the **scopes** found in the token into RabbitMQ **permissions** (the same
   permissions used in the RabbitMQ's internal database).

| `auth_oauth2.jwks_uri`                    | The URL of the [JWKS endpoint](#jwks-endpoint). According to the [JWT Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.2), the endpoint URL must be https. Optional if you set `auth_oauth2.issuer`. If this URL is set, it overrides the `jwks_uri` discovered via the discovery endpoint. |
| `auth_oauth2.jwks_url`                    | This variable is **deprecated** and you should use instead `auth_oauth2.jwks_uri`. In RabbitMQ 4.2.0, this variable will be removed. In the meantime, RabbitMQ supports it until you change your configuration. |
| `auth_oauth2.token_endpoint`              | The URL of the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint. Optional if you set `auth_oauth2.issuer`. If this URL is set, it overrides the `token_endpoint` discovered via the discovery endpoint. |

## Resource Server ID {#resource-server-id}

A RabbitMQ cluster must have at least one resource server identifier configured. If it has just one
resource, this is configured in the `auth_oauth2.resource_server_id` variable and it is
**mandatory**. If the RabbitMQ cluster has more than one OAuth resource then they are configured
under `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.<index>` and in this case `auth_oauth2.resource_server_id`
variable is not mandatory.

RabbitMQ uses the resource server identity for these two purposes:

- To validate the token's audience (`aud`) whose value must contain the resource server identifier.
  This validation can be disabled though.
- To initiate the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow in the Management UI. This is the flow used to
  authenticate a user and to get its access token. RabbitMQ must include the resource server
  identifier in the request's attribute called `resource`.

## Scope Prefix {#scope-prefix}

OAuth 2.0 tokens use scopes to communicate what set of permissions particular client are granted.
The scopes are free form strings.

By default, `resource_server_id` followed by the dot (`.`) character is the prefix used for scopes
to avoid scope collisions (or unintended overlap). However, in some environments, it is not possible
to use `resource_server_id` as the prefix for all scopes. For these environments, there is a new
variable called `scope_prefix` which overrides the default scope prefix.

Given the below configuration, the scope associated with the permission `read:*/*` is `api://read:*/*`.

```ini
...
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = api://
...
```

To use an empty string as prefix, use this configuration:

```ini
...
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = ''
...
```

## Scope Aliases {#scope-aliases}

:::important

Scope aliases are necessary when scopes in the RabbitMQ format cannot be configured on the identity
provider (IDP) side

:::

A scope alias is a mapping between a custom JWT token scope and a set of RabbitMQ-specific scopes. A
custom scope can also be defined as any scope which is not recognized by RabbitMQ's OAuth 2
subsystem.

Scope aliases are necessary when scopes in the RabbitMQ format cannot be configured on the identity
provider (IDP) side. Instead, a set of names is configured on the IDP side, and mapped to a set of
scoped that RabbitMQ can parse and use.

For example, let's consider an identity provider with the following two roles:

* `admin`
* `developer`

These roles should be mapped to the following RabbitMQ scopes:

* `admin` to `rabbitmq.tag:administrator rabbitmq.read:*/`
* `developer` to `rabbitmq.tag:management rabbitmq.read:*/* rabbitmq.write:*/* rabbitmq.configure:*/*`

The following `rabbitmq.conf` example performs the aforementioned mapping using scope aliases. The
mapping can be one-to-one or one-to-many:

```ìni
# ...
# the "admin" role above
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.admin = rabbitmq.tag:administrator rabbitmq.read:*/
# the "developer" role above
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.developer = rabbitmq.tag:management rabbitmq.read:*/* rabbitmq.write:*/* rabbitmq.configure:*/*
# ...
```

Sometimes an alias may have to use special characters and symbols including the separator character,
`.`. In those cases, configure the scope aliases as follows:

```ìni
# ...
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.1.alias = api://admin
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.1.scope = rabbitmq.tag:administrator rabbitmq.read:*/
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.2.alias = api://developer.All
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.2.scope = rabbitmq.tag:management rabbitmq.read:*/* rabbitmq.write:*/* rabbitmq.configure:*/*
# ...
```

## Signing Keys Files {#signing-key-files}

The following configuration declares two signing keys and configures the kid of the default signing
key. For more information check the section [Configure Signing keys](#configure-signing-keys).

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = new_resource_server_id
auth_oauth2.default_key = id1
auth_oauth2.signing_keys.id1 = test/config_schema_SUITE_data/certs/key.pem
auth_oauth2.signing_keys.id2 = test/config_schema_SUITE_data/certs/cert.pem
auth_oauth2.algorithms.1 = HS256
auth_oauth2.algorithms.2 = RS256
```

## JWKS endpoint {#jwks-endpoint}

The following configuration sets the JWKS endpoint from which RabbitMQ downloads the signing keys
using the configured CA certificate and TLS variables.

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = new_resource_server_id
auth_oauth2.jwks_uri = https://my-jwt-issuer/jwks.json
auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile = test/config_schema_SUITE_data/certs/cacert.pem
auth_oauth2.https.peer_verification = verify_peer
auth_oauth2.https.depth = 5
auth_oauth2.https.fail_if_no_peer_cert = true
auth_oauth2.https.hostname_verification = wildcard
auth_oauth2.algorithms.1 = HS256
auth_oauth2.algorithms.2 = RS256
```

## Multiple Resource Servers Сonfiguration {#multiple-resource-servers-configuration}

Each `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.<id/index>.` entry has the following variables shown in the table
below. Except for the variables `id` and `oauth_provider_id`, if a resource does not configure a
variable, RabbitMQ uses the variable configured at the root level. For instance, if the resource
`auth_oauth2.resource_servers.prod` does not configure `preferred_username_claims` variable,
RabbitMQ uses the value configured in `auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims` for the resource
`prod`.

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`                        | The [Resource Server ID](#resource-server-id).               |

| `preferred_username_claims` | [List of the JWT claims](#preferred-username-claims) to look for the username associated with the token separated by commas. |
| `oauth_provider_id`         | The identifier of the OAuth Provider associated to this resource. RabbitMQ uses the signing keys issued by this OAuth Provider to validate tokens whose audience matches this resource's id. |

All available configurable parameters for each OAuth 2 provider is documented [in a separate section](#multiple-oauth-providers-configuration).

Usually, a numeric value is used as `index`, for example
`auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod`. However, it can be any string, for example
`auth_oauth2.resource_servers.rabbit_prod.jwks_uri = http://some_url`. By default, the `index` is
the resource server's id. However, you can override it via the `id` variable like in
`auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod`.

Here is an example which configures two resources (`prod` and `dev`) which are used by the users and
clients managed by the same identity provider whose issuer url is `https://my-idp.com/`:

```ini
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://my-idp.com/
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = dev
```

See the advanced usage section called [Multiple Resource Servers](#multiple-resource-servers) for
more information on how to configure them.

## Multiple OAuth Providers Сonfiguration {#multiple-oauth-providers-configuration}

Each `auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.{id/index}` entry has the following sub-keys.

| Key                           | Documentation                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `issuer`                      | URL of OAuth Provider. It is used to build the discovery endpoint URL and/or to redirect RabbitMQ Management users to login and get a token. |
| `discovery_endpoint_path`     | The path used for the OpenId discovery endpoint. Default value is `.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| `discovery_endpoint_params`   | [List of HTTP query parameters](#discovery-endpoint-params) sent to the OpenId discovery endpoint. |
| `token_endpoint`              | The URL of the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint. Optional if you configured `issuer`. |
| `jwks_uri`                    | The URL of the [JWKS endpoint](#jwks-endpoint). According to the [JWT Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.2), the endpoint URL must be https. This variable is optional if you set `issuer`. |
| `https.cacertfile`            | Path to a file containing PEM-encoded CA certificates used to connect `issuer` and/or `jwks_uri` URLs. |
| `https.depth`                 | The maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates that may follow the peer certificate in a valid [certification path](ssl#peer-verification-depth). The default value is 10. |
| `https.verify`                | Configures [peer verification](ssl#peer-verification). Available values: `verify_none`, `verify_peer`. The default value is `verify_peer` if there are trusted CA installed in the OS or `auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile` is set. |
| `https.fail_if_no_peer_cert`  | Used together with `auth_oauth2.https.peer_verification = verify_peer`. When set to `true`, TLS connection will be rejected if the client fails to provide a certificate. The default value is `false`. |
| `https.hostname_verification` | Enable wildcard-aware hostname verification for key server. Available values: `wildcard`, `none`. The default value is `none`. |
| `https.crl_check`             | [Perform CRL verification](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ssl#type-crl_check) (Certificate Revocation List) verification. Default value is false. |
| `auth_oauth2.proxy`           | Configures explicit [forward proxy](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/data-solutions/tanzu-rabbitmq-oci/4-0/tanzu-rabbitmq-oci-image/overview.html) used to connect to the `issuer` URL. **This is a commercial-only feature**. More information on how to use it can be found on [this example](./oauth2-examples-forward-proxy). |
| `signing_keys`                | Local filesystem paths to the [signing key files](#signing-key-files). The files must exist and be readable. |
| `default_key`                 | ID of the default signing key.                               |
| `algorithms`                  | Used to restrict [the list of enabled algorithms](https://github.com/potatosalad/erlang-jose#algorithm-support). |

Here is an example that configures two resources (`prod` and `dev`) where each resource is managed
by two distinct identity providers:

```ini
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.oauth_provider_id = idp_prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.oauth_provider_id = idp_dev
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.idp_prod.issuer = https://idp_prod.com
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.idp_dev.issuer = https://idp_dev.com
```

See the advanced usage section called [Multiple OAuth Providers](#multiple-oauth-providers) for more
information on how to configure them.

### Token validation {#token-validation}

When RabbitMQ receives a JWT token, it validates it before accepting it.

#### Must be digitally signed

The token must carry a digital signature and optionally a `kid` header attribute which identifies
the key RabbitMQ should use to validate the signature.

#### Must not be expired

RabbitMQ uses this field `exp` ([exp](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#page-9)) to validate the
token if present. It contains the expiration time after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for
processing.

#### Audience must have/match the resource_server_id

The `aud` ([Audience](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#page-9)) identifies the recipients and/or
resource_server of the JWT.

By default, **RabbitMQ uses this field to validate the token**. This validation can be disabled by
setting the `auth_oauth2.verify_aud` setting set to `false`. When verification is enabled, this
`aud` field must either match the `resource_server_id` value or, in case of a list, it must contain
the `resource_server_id` value.

### Token expiration and refresh {#token-expiration}

In RabbitMQ, token expiration and refresh processes vary between AMQP 1.0 and AMQP 0.9.1 protocols.

For AMQP 1.0, if the latest token on an existing connection expires, RabbitMQ disconnects the
client. To prevent disconnection, the client can proactively refresh the token before it expires.
The client can set a new token by sending an
[HTTP-over-AMQP 1.0](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/amqp-specs/blob/master/http-over-amqp-v1.0-wd06a.docx)
request. This request uses a `PUT` operation on the `/auth/tokens` endpoint, with the token included
in the body as a
[binary](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-binary)
[AMQP value](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-amqp-value).
RabbitMQ’s AMQP 1.0 clients support token refresh in
[Java](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp-java-client),
[.NET](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp-dotnet-client), and
[Erlang](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/main/deps/rabbitmq_amqp_client).

For AMQP 0.9.1, when a token expires on an existing connection, the broker refuses further
operations after a limited time, but does not disconnect the client. To refresh the token, the
client can use the AMQP 0.9.1 [update-secret](./extensions) protocol method if supported by the
client. For an example, see the
[Java client documentation](/client-libraries/java-api-guide#oauth2-refreshing-token). If the client
does not support `update-secret`, it must disconnect and reconnect with a new token.

### Scope-to-Permission translation {#scope-translation}

Scopes are translated into permission grants to RabbitMQ resources for the provided token.

The current scope format is `<permission>:<vhost_pattern>/<name_pattern>[/<routing_key_pattern>]`
where

* `<permission>` is an access permission (`configure`, `read`, or `write`)
* `<vhost_pattern>` is a wildcard pattern for vhosts token has access to.
* `<name_pattern>` is a wildcard pattern for resource name
* `<routing_key_pattern>` is a wildcard pattern for routing key in topic authorization

Wildcard patterns are strings with optional wildcard symbols `*` that match
any sequence of characters.

Wildcard patterns match as following:

* `*` matches any string
* `foo*` matches any string starting with a `foo`
* `*foo` matches any string ending with a `foo`
* `foo*bar` matches any string starting with a `foo` and ending with a `bar`

There can be multiple wildcards in a pattern:

* `start*middle*end`
* `*before*after*`

**To use special characters such as `*`, `%`, or `/` in a wildcard pattern, the pattern must be
[URL-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).**

These are the usually permissions examples:

- `read:*/*`(`read:*/*/*`) - read permissions to any resource on any vhost
- `write:*/*`(`write:*/*/*`) - write permissions to any resource on any vhost
- `read:vhost1/*`(`read:vhost1/*/*`) - read permissions to any resource on the `vhost1` vhost
- `read:vhost1/some*` - read permissions to all the resources, starting with `some` on the `vhost1`
  vhost
- `write:vhost1/some*/routing*` - topic write permissions to publish to an exchange starting with
  `some` with a routing key starting with `routing`
- `read:*/*/*` and `write:*/*/*` - queue binding permissions required to bind a queue on a topic
  exchange with any routing key

See the
[wildcard matching test suite](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2/test/wildcard_match_SUITE.erl)
and
[scopes test suite](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2/test/scope_SUITE.erl)
for more examples.

Scopes, by default, are prefixed with `resource_server_id` followed by the dot (`.`) character if
`scope_prefix` is not configured. For example, if `resource_server_id` is "my_rabbit", a scope to
enable read from any vhost will be `my_rabbit.read:*/*`.

If `scope_prefix` is configured then scopes are prefixed as follows: `<scope_prefix><permission>`.
For example, if `scope_prefix` is `api://` and the permission is `read:*/*` the scope would be
`api://read:*/*`

#### Variable expansion 

OAuth 2.0 authorisation backend supports variable expansion when checking permission on vhosts and resources 
such as queues and exchanges.
Variabbles can be any JWT claims whose value is a plain string and/or the `vhost` variable.

For example, a user connected with the token below to the vhost `prod` should have a write
permission on all exchanges starting with `x-prod-`, and any routing key starting with `u-bob-`, 
where `bob` comes from the `sub` JWT claim:

```json
{
  "sub" : "bob",
  "scope" : [ "rabbitmq.write:*/x-{vhost}-*/u-{sub}-*" ]
}
```

### Topic Exchange scopes {#topic-exchange-scopes}

The [previous](#scope-translation) section explained, in detail, how permissions are mapped to
scopes. This section explains more specifically what scopes you need in order to operate on
**Topic Exchanges**.

To bind and/or unbind a queue to/from a **Topic Exchange**, you need to have the following scopes:

- **write** permission on the queue and routing key -> `rabbitmq.write:<vhost>/<queue>/<routingkey>`

> for example `rabbitmq.write:*/*/*`

- **read** permission on the exchange and routing key -> `rabbitmq.write:<vhost>/<exchange>/<routingkey>`

> for example `rabbitmq.read:*/*/*`

To publish to a **Topic Exchange**, you need to have the following scope:

- **write** permission on the exchange and routing key -> `rabbitmq.write:<vhost>/<exchange>/<routingkey>`

> for example `rabbitmq.write:*/*/*`

#### Variable expansion 

OAuth 2.0 authorisation backend supports variable expansion when checking permission on topics.
It supports JWT claims whose value is a plain string, plus the `vhost` variable.

For example, a user connected with the token below to the vhost `prod` should have a write
permission on all exchanges starting with `x-prod-`, and any routing key starting with `u-bob-`:

```json
{
  "sub" : "bob",
  "scope" : [ "rabbitmq.write:*/x-{vhost}-*/u-{sub}-*" ]
}
```

### Scope and tags {#scope-and-tags}

Users in RabbitMQ can have [tags associated with them](./access-control#user-tags). Tags are used to
[control access to the management plugin](./management#permissions).

In the OAuth context, tags can be added as part of the scope, using a format like
`<resource_server_id>.tag:<tag>`. For example, if the `resource_server_id` is "my_rabbit", a scope
to grant access to the management plugin with the `monitoring` tag will be
`my_rabbit.tag:monitoring`.

## Basic usage {#basic-usage}

### Configure OAuth 2.0 provider's issuer {#configure-issuer}

Before RabbitMQ 3.13, users had to either configure the JWKS endpoint (that is `auth_oauth2.jwks_uri`
variable) or statically [configure the signing keys](#configure-signing-keys). Now, users only need
to configure the OpenID Provider's **issuer** URL and from this URL RabbitMQ downloads the OpenID
Provider configuration which includes the JWKS endpoint in addition to other endpoints which will be
useful in other contexts.

Usually, this **issuer** URL is the same URL configured in the management plugin
(`management.oauth_provider_url`). From now on, you only need to configure a single URL, specified
by the `auth_oauth2.issuer` variable. Except in edge cases where the **issuer** URL does not host
the login page. In those cases, the user configures the login page in the
`management.oauth_provider_url` variable.

Sample configuration using issuer:

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = my_rabbit_server
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://my-idp-provider/somerealm
```

Sample configuration which configures the `jwks_uri` rather than the issuer:

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = my_rabbit_server
auth_oauth2.jwks_uri = "https://my-jwt-issuer/jwks.json
```

:::info
If you have both endpoints configured, RabbitMQ uses `jwks_uri` because it does not need to discover
it via the `issuer` URL.
:::

:::info
**Note about TLS variables for the `jwks_uri` or the `issuer` url**: TLS variable such as the
`cacertfile` are configured as follows regardless which URL you are using:
:::

```ini
...
auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/cacert.pem
...
```

**VERY IMPORTANT**: Since RabbitMQ 3.13, if `auth_oauth2.https.peer_verification` variable is not
set, RabbitMQ sets it to `verify_peer` as long as there are trusted certificates installed in the OS
or the user configured `auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile`.

### Configure signing keys {#configure-signing-keys}

Currently, it is very rare you configure RabbitMQ with signing keys, when RabbitMQ can automatically
download them as explained in the previous section. However, RabbitMQ supports those edge cases
where you need to statically configure the signing keys, or when you need to support symmetric
signing keys as opposed to the most widely used asymmetric keys.

The following example uses [Cloud Foundry UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) as the OAuth 2.0
provider.

To get the signing key from the [OAuth 2.0 provider UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa), use
the
[token_key endpoint](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/4.6.0/index.html#token-key-s) or
[uaac](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac) (the `uaac signing key` command).

The following fields are required: `kty`, `value`, `alg`, and `kid`.

Assuming UAA reports the following signing key information:

```erlang
uaac signing key
  kty: RSA
  e: AQAB
  use: sig
  kid: a-key-ID
  alg: RS256
  value: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

```

it translates into the following configuration (in the [advanced RabbitMQ config format](./configure)):

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = my_rabbit_server
auth_oauth2.signing_keys.a-key-ID = /path-to-signing-key-pem-file
```

If a symmetric key is used, the configuration looks like this:

```erlang
[
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
    {resource_server_id, <<"my_rabbit_server">>},
    {key_config, [
      {signing_keys, #{
        <<"a-key-ID">> => {map, #{<<"kty">> => <<"MAC">>,
                                  <<"alg">> => <<"HS256">>,
                                  <<"value">> => <<"my_signing_key">>}}
      }}
    ]}
  ]},
].
```

### Use a different token field for the scope {#use-different-token-field}

The plugin always extracts the scopes from the `scope` claim. However, you can also configure the
plugin to look in other claims using the `auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key` variable.

The scopes found in the `scope` claim must be of these two value types:

- **string separated by spaces** like `my_id.configure:*/* my_id.read:*/* my_id.write:*/*`
- **list** like `["my_id.configure:*/*", "my_id.read:*/*", "my_id.write:*/*"]`

The scopes found in any claim listed in the `auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key` variable can be
of several types in addition to the two value types supported by the `scope` claim mentioned earlier.

#### Map of scopes indexed by resource_server_id {#map-of-scopes-indexed-by-resource-id}

This is an example of a token where scopes are not yet prefixed with the `resource_server_id`,
but are indexed by the `resource_server_id`:

```ini
{
 "exp": 1618592626,
 "iat": 1618578226,
 "aud" : ["my_id"],
 ...
 "complex_claim_as_string": {
    "rabbitmq": ["configure:*/* read:*/* write:*/*"]
 },
 "complex_claim_as_list": {
    "rabbitmq": ["configure:vhost1/*", "read:vhost1/*", "write:vhost1/*"]
 }
 ...
}
```

With the following plugin configuration, the plugin reads the scopes from two additional claims:
`complex_claim_as_string` and `complex_claim_as_list`. The plugin reads the scopes and adds the key
value as prefix. For example, given the scope `configure:*/*` it produces `rabbitmq.configure:*/*`.

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = my_rabbit_server
auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key = complex_claim_as_string complex_claim_as_list
```

#### Scopes nested deep in Maps and Lists

This is the case for tokens issued by the Keycloak Identity Provider, but can be applied to any
token from any provider.

This first token format stores scopes deep in maps and lists.

```json
{
  "authorization": {
    "permissions": [
      {
        "scopes": [
          "rabbitmq-resource.read:*/*"
        ],
        "rsid": "2c390fe4-02ad-41c7-98a2-cebb8c60ccf1",
        "rsname": "allvhost"
      },
      {
        "scopes": [
          "rabbitmq-resource.write:vhost1/*"
        ],
        "rsid": "e7f12e94-4c34-43d8-b2b1-c516af644cee",
        "rsname": "vhost1"
      },
      {
        "scopes": [
          "rabbitmq-resource.tag:administrator"
        ],
        "rsid": "12ac3d1c-28c2-4521-8e33-0952eff10bd9"
      }
    ]
  },
  "scope": "email profile rabbitmq-resource.tag:monitoring",
}
```

Given the following configuration:

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = my_rabbit_server
auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key = authorization.permissions.scopes
```

The plugin navigates the token structure following this logic:

1. It looks up the claim `authorization`.
2. It finds a map, it then looks for the next claim `permissions`.
3. This time, it finds a list of maps. It goes over all the items in the list.
4. For each map in the list, it looks up the next claim `scopes`.
5. The value can be a list of scopes or a comma-separated string of scopes or a
   [map of scopes indexed by resource_server_id](#map-of-scopes-indexed-by-resource-id).

Additionally, the plugin always reads the scopes from the official `scope` claim.

With the above token and plugin's configuration, the list of scopes are following:

- `rabbitmq-resource.tag:monitoring`
- `rabbitmq-resource.read:*/*`
- `rabbitmq-resource.write:vhost1/*`
- `rabbitmq-resource.tag:administrator`

In summary, the plugin is able to navigate the token to find the scopes using the appropriate path.

For example, in each intermediary stage after finding `authorization` and/or `permissions` keys, the
value can be another Map or a List of Maps. In the last stage, after finding the last `scopes` key,
the value can be any of any of the value types explained in the previous section.

These are:

- **string separated by spaces** such as `my_id.configure:*/* my_id.read:*/* my_id.write:*/*`
- **list** such as `["my_id.configure:*/*", "my_id.read:*/*", "my_id.write:*/*"]`
- [Map of scopes indexed by resource server id](#map-of-scopes-indexed-by-resource-id)

### Preferred username claims {#preferred-username-claims}

The user name associated with the token must be available to RabbitMQ so that this user name is
displayed in the RabbitMQ Management UI. By default, RabbitMQ searches for the `sub` claim first,
and if it is not found, RabbitMQ uses the `client_id`.

Most authorization servers return the user's GUID in the `sub` claim instead of the user's user name
or email address, anything the user can relate to. When the `sub` claim does not carry a
*user-friendly username*, you can configure one or several claims to extract the user name from the
token.

Example `rabbitmq.conf` configuration:

``` ini
# ...
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq
auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims.1 = user_name
auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims.2 = email
# ...
```

In the example configuration, RabbitMQ searches for the `user_name` claim first and if it is not
found, RabbitMQ searches for the `email`. If these are not found, RabbitMQ uses its default lookup
mechanism which first looks for `sub` and then `client_id`.

### Discovery endpoint parameters {#discovery-endpoint-params}

Some OAuth 2.0 providers requires certain query parameters in the OpenId Discovery endpoint. For
instance, Microsoft Entra ID requires a query parameter called `appid` when the application uses
custom signing keys. The discovery endpoint returns an OpenId configuration tailored for the
application that matches the `appid`. For instance, the `jkws_uri` endpoint returned in the OpenId
configuration has already the query parameters sent to the discovery endpoint.

Here is an example of setting these parameters including the rest of the variables used to build the
OpenId discovery endpoint URL.

``` ini
# ...
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://myissuer.com/v2
auth_oauth2.discovery_endpoint_path = .well-known/authorization-server
auth_oauth2.discovery_endpoint_params.param1 = value1
auth_oauth2.discovery_endpoint_params.param2 = value2
# ...
```

This is the URL built to access the OpenId Discovery endpoint:

```console
https://myissuer.com/v2/.well-known/authorization-server?param1=value1&param2=value2
```

### Requesting Party Token {#requesting-party-token}

A **Requesting Party Token (RPT)** is a special OAuth 2.0 **access token** issued by an
**Authorization Server** in the
[User-Managed Access (UMA) 2.0](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html)
framework. It is used by a **Requesting Party** (such as an application or user) to access a
protected resource on a Resource Server such as RabbitMQ, after being authorized based on
resource-owner policies.

[Keycloak](./oauth2-examples-keycloak) is one of the Authorization Servers that issues this type of
token. An RPT is typically a JWT with permissions claims under a claim called `authorization`. See
the example below. The rest of the claims have been removed from the token for brevity:

```json
{
  "authorization": {
    "permissions": [
      {
        "scopes": [
          "rabbitmq-resource.read:*/*"
        ],
        "rsid": "2c390fe4-02ad-41c7-98a2-cebb8c60ccf1",
        "rsname": "allvhost"
      },
      {
        "scopes": [
          "rabbitmq-resource:vhost1/*"
        ],
        "rsid": "e7f12e94-4c34-43d8-b2b1-c516af644cee",
        "rsname": "vhost1"
      },
      {
        "rsid": "12ac3d1c-28c2-4521-8e33-0952eff10bd9",
        "scopes": [
          "rabbitmq-resource.tag:administrator"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "scope": "email profile",
}
```

RabbitMQ supports this token format. It reads all the scopes in all the `permissions` claims. If the
token also contains the standard `scope` claim, RabbitMQ adds it to the list of scopes presented by
the token.

### Rich Authorization Request {#rich-authorization-request}

The [Rich Authorization Request](https://oauth.net/2/rich-authorization-requests/) extension
provides a way for OAuth clients to request fine-grained permissions during an authorization
request. It moves away from the concept of scopes that are text labels and instead defines a more
sophisticated permission model.

RabbitMQ supports JWT tokens compliant with the extension. Below is a sample example section of JWT
token:

```javascript
{
  "authorization_details": [
    {
      "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance/vhost:production-*"],
      "actions": [ "read", "write", "configure"  ]
    },
    {
      "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance", "cluster:inventory" ],
      "actions": ["administrator" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The token above contains two permissions under the attribute `authorization_details`. Both
permissions are meant for RabbitMQ servers with `resource_server_type` set to `rabbitmq`. This field
identifies RabbitMQ-specific permissions.

The first permission grants `read`, `write` and `configure` permissions to any queue and/or exchange
on any virtual host whose name matches the pattern `production-*`, and that reside in clusters whose
`resource_server_id` contains the string `finance`. The `cluster` attribute's value is also a
regular expression. To match exactly the string `finance`, use `^finance$`.

The second permission grants the `administrator` user tag in two clusters, `finance` and
`inventory`. Other supported user tags as `management`, `policymaker` and `monitoring`.

#### Type field

In order for a RabbitMQ node to accept a permission, its value must match that node's
`resource_server_type` variable's value. A JWT token may have permissions for multiple resource
types.

#### Locations field

The `locations` field can be either a string containing a single location or a Json array containing
zero or many locations.

A location consists of a list of key-value pairs separated by forward slash `/` character. Here is
the format:

```bash
cluster:<resource_server_id_pattern>[/vhost:<vhost_pattern>][/queue:<queue_name_pattern>|/exchange:<exchange_name_pattern>][/routing-key:<routing_key_pattern>]
```

Any string separated by `/` which does not conform to `<key>:<value>` is ignored. For instance, if
your locations start with a prefix, for example `vrn/cluster:rabbitmq`, the `vrn` pattern part is
ignored.

The supported location's attributed are:

- `cluster`: This is the only mandatory attribute. It is a wildcard pattern which must match
  RabbitMQ's `resource_server_id` otherwise the location is ignored.
- `vhost`: This is the virtual host you are granting access to. It also a wildcard pattern. If not
  specified, `*` will be used.
- `queue`|`exchange`: queue or exchange name pattern. The location grants the permission to a set of
  queues (or exchanges) that match it. One location can only specify either `queue` or `exchange`
  but not both. If not specified, `*` will be used
- `routing-key`: this is the routing key pattern the location grants the permission to. If not
  specified, `*` will be used

For more information about wildcard patterns, check the section
[Scope-to-Permission Translation](#scope-translation).

#### Actions field

The `actions` field can be either a string containing a single action or a Json array containing
zero or many actions.

The supported actions map to either [RabbitMQ permissions](./access-control#authorisation):

- `configure`
- `read`
- `write`

Or RabbitMQ user tags:

- `administrator`
- `monitoring`
- `management`
- `policymaker`

#### Rich-Permission to scope translation

Rich Authorization Request permissions are translated into JWT token scopes that use the
aforementioned convention using the following algorithm:

For each location found in the `locations` where the `cluster` attribute matches the current
RabbitMQ server's `resource_server_id`:

- For each location found in the `locations` field where the `cluster` attribute matches the current
  RabbitMQ node's `resource_server_id`, the plugin extracts the `vhost`, `queue` or `exchange` and
  `routing_key` attributes from the location. If the location does not have any of those attributes,
  the default value of `*` is assumed. Out of those values, the following scope suffix will be
  produced:

  ```ini
  scope_suffix = <vhost>/<queue>|<exchange>/<routing-key>
  ```

- For each action found in the `actions` field:

  If the action is not a known user tag, the following scope is produced out of it:

  ```ini
    scope = <resource_server_id>.<action>:<scope_suffix>
  ```

  For known user tag actions, the following scope is produced:

  ```ini
    scope = <resource_server_id>.<action>
  ```

The plugin produces permutations of all `actions` by all `locations` that match the node's
configured `resource_server_id`.

In the following RAR example

```javascript
{
  "authorization_details": [
    { "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance/vhost:primary-*"],
      "actions": [ "read", "write", "configure"  ]
    },
    { "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance", "cluster:inventory" ],
      "actions": ["administrator" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

If RabbitMQ nodes `resource_server_id` is equal to `finance`, the plugin computes the following sets
of scopes:

- `finance.read:primary-*/*/*`
- `finance.write:primary-*/*/*`
- `finance.configure:primary-*/*/*`
- `finance.tag:administrator`

### Support Opaque tokens {#support-opaque-tokens}

Opaque tokens are essentially random strings generated by the authorization server rather than 
JWT which is made up of 3 JSON objects separated by the dot character and base64 encoded. 
JWT tokens supported by RabbitMQ must be digitally signed, whereas opaque tokens 
and the introspected token are not digitally signed. 

RabbitMQ must send the opaque token to an HTTP endpoint, called Introspection Endpoint, 
to check if the token is still valid and to get its payload, i.e. the expiry date and the scopes.

RabbitMQ backend will introspect the token once for the duration of the connection. In other words,
when an application connects over one of the supported protocols like AMQP with an opaque token,
RabbitMQ sends the opaque token to the introspection endpoint. If the token is valid, the token's 
payload is cached for the duration of the connection. 

#### Introspection endpoint 

If you have configured `auth_oauth2.issuer`, RabbitMQ will automatically discover the 
introspection endpoint's url. However, if the authorization server does not include that endpoint, you 
can configure it like shown below:

```ini 
auth_oauth2.introspection_endpoint = https://someurl-to-introspection-endpoint 
```

#### Configure Introspection endpoint credentials 

The OAuth 2.0 introspection endpoint, defined in RFC 7662, requires authentication. This authentication is typically achieved using client credentials, which can be provided via Basic Authentication (`basic`) or as POST parameters (`request_param`).

```ini
auth_oauth2.introspection_client_auth_method = basic
auth_oauth2.introspection_client_id = some-client-id
auth_oauth2.introspection_client_secret = some-client-secret
```

If the authorization server expects credentials in request parameters, use `request_param` instead `basic`. 

#### Optional - Configure symmetrical signing key for opaque tokens

If you want to support opaque tokens to authenticate via the [management UI](./management), you must
configure a symmetrical signing key (HS256). In the contrary, you do not need to configure a symmetrical signing key for opaque tokens. 

When a management user tries to authenticate with an opaque token, RabbitMQ must first 
validate it and get its coresponding JWT's payload by contacting the introspection endpoint.
If the token is valid, RabbitMQ signs the JWT's payload of the opaque token and sends it back to the mamangement ui. 
From then on, the management ui uses the newly issued JWT token to authorize the user's requests.

Here is a sample configuration:

```ini 
auth_oauth2.opaque_token_signing_key.id = rabbit_kid
auth_oauth2.opaque_token_signing_key.key = "hello-world-symmetrical-key"
```

:::info
RabbitMQ only supports symmetrical signing key (HS256) to sign introspected 
opaque tokens. In future versions, it may add support for asymmetrical signing key.

## Advanced usage {#advanced-usage}

### Use default OAuth 2.0 provider {#use-oauth-provider}

As long as you have only one OAuth 2.0 provider, you can skip this advanced usage although you can
use it.

Under the [basic usage](#configure-issuer) section, you configured the `issuer` url or maybe the
`jwks_uri` along with the TLS variables if needed. This advanced usage configures everything
relative to the OAuth provider into a dedicated configuration.

Here is an example configuration that uses `issuer` to configure the identity provider's URL:

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq-prod
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod
auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/prodcacert.pem
```

The equivalent configuration where the identity provider is configured under
`auth_oauth2.oauth_providers` variable is:

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq-prod
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider = prodkeycloak

auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prodkeycloak.issuer = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prodkeycloak.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/prodcacert.pem
```

This latter configuration is more relevant when users present tokens which are issued or signed by
different OAuth 2.0 providers. However, one can still use it provided
`auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider` is set.

### Configure OAuth 2.0 provider's end_session_endpoint {#configure-end-session-endpoint}

This advanced setting is only required when the
[OpenId Connect Discovery endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationRequest)
does not return an `end_session_endpoint` and you want Single Logout functionality. In other words,
when the user logs out from the management UI it is also logged out from the OAuth Provider.

:::info
If the [OpenId Connect Discovery endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationRequest)
response does include an `end_session_endpoint`, the management UI uses it over the configured
endpoint.
:::

Here is an example configuration that sets `end_session_endpoint`:

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq-prod
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod
auth_oauth2.end_session_endpoint = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod/logout
```

The equivalent configuration where the identity provider is configured under
`auth_oauth2.oauth_providers` variable is:

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq-prod
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider = prodkeycloak

auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prodkeycloak.issuer = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prodkeycloak.end_session_endpoint = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod/logout
```

### Configure multiple resource servers {#multiple-resource-servers}

Usually, all users that access a RabbitMQ cluster are registered within the same identity provider.
Likewise, all tokens targeting the same RabbitMQ cluster also carry the same *audience*. In other
words, all users reference a RabbitMQ cluster with the same resource name which must match the value
of the `auth_oauth2.resource_server_id` variable.

However, there are some use-cases where RabbitMQ is accessed by users registered in different
identity providers or tokens are issued for the same RabbitMQ installation but with different
*Audience*(s). For these use-cases, RabbitMQ OAuth 2.0 plugin and the Management plugin can be
configured with multiple OAuth 2.0 resources.

The following is the OAuth 2.0 plugin configuration for two resources with the ids: `rabbit_prod`
and `rabbit_dev`. Both resources (also known as *audience*) are managed by the same Identity
Provider whose issuer is `http//some_idp_url`.

```ini
auth_oauth2.issuer = http//some_idp_url
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.

auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = rabbit_dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.scope_prefix = dev-rabbitmq.
```

All resource servers share the variables you set so far under `auth_oauth2.` such as `scope_prefix`.
However, they can override them. Here are the list of variables a resource server can override:

- `id` - This is the actual resource identifier carried in the `audience` field of a token. If
  omitted, the value is the index, for example, given
  `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.prod.scope_prefix` variable, the `id` would be `prod`.

- `scope_prefix`

- `additional_scopes_key`

- `resource_server_type`

- `oauth_provider_id` - This is the identifier of the OAuth provider. It is configured in RabbitMQ.
  It provides all the variables to contact the authorization server and discover all its endpoints,
  such as the `jwks_uri` to download the signing keys to validate the token.

  If this variable is omitted, RabbitMQ looks up the default Authorization Provider's id in the
  variable `auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider`, and if it is also omitted, RabbitMQ uses
  `auth_oauth2.issuer` or `auth_oauth2.jwks_uri` to download the signings keys to validate the
  token.

The list of supported resource servers is the combination of `auth_oauth2.resource_servers` and
`auth_oauth2.resource_server_id`. You can use both or only one of them.

:::info

There is an [example](./oauth2-examples-multiresource) that demonstrate how to use multiple OAuth 2
resources.

:::

A list of [all the configurable variables](#multiple-resource-servers-configuration) for each OAuth
Provider is documented in a separate section.

### Configure multiple OAuth 2.0 providers {#multiple-oauth-providers}

It only makes sense to set multiple OAuth 2.0 providers if there are
[multiple resources configured](#multiple-resource-servers).

This is the configuration used in the previous section but modified to use multiple OAuth 2.0
providers:

```ini
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.

auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.oauth_provider_id = prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = rabbit_dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.oauth_provider_id = dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.scope_prefix = dev-rabbitmq.

auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prod.issuer = https://rabbit_prod:8080
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prod.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/prod.pem
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.dev.issuer = https://rabbit_dev:8080
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.dev.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/dev.pem
```

A list of [all the configurable variables](#multiple-resource-servers-configuration) for each OAuth
Provider is documented in a separate section.

## Examples {#examples}

The [RabbitMQ OAuth 2.0 Auth backend examples](./oauth2-examples) contain many example configuration
files, that can be used to set up several OAuth 2.0 providers, including UAA, Auth0, and Azure, and
issue tokens, which can be used to access RabbitMQ resources.

# OAuth 2.0 Authentication Backend

## Overview {#overview}

This [RabbitMQ authentication/authorisation backend](./access-control) plugin lets applications (clients) and users authenticate and authorize using JWT-encoded OAuth 2.0 access tokens.

There's also a companion [troubleshooting guide for OAuth 2-specific problems](./troubleshooting-oauth2).

## How it works {#how-it-works}

The OAuth 2 plugin must be activated (or [pre-configured](./plugins#enabled-plugins-file)) before it can be used,
like all other plugins:

```bash
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2
```

Then it must be specified as one of the [authN and/or authZ backends](./access-control#backends). The following example enables OAuth 2.0 authentication and authorization backends:

```ini
# note that the module name begins with a "rabbit_", not "rabbitmq_", like in the name
# of the plugin
auth_backends.1 = rabbit_auth_backend_oauth2
```

Next, let's take a look at the workflows the OAuth 2 plugin supports.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To use the OAuth 2 plugin, all RabbitMQ nodes must be

1. [Configured to use the rabbit_auth_backend_oauth2 backend](./access-control).
2. [Configured with the resource service ID](#resource-server-id) (`resource_server_id`). The RabbitMQ cluster becomes an OAuth 2.0 resource and this is its identifier.
3. [Configured with issuer URL](#configure-issuer) of the OAuth 2.0 provider, or the JWKS URL, or directly with the signing keys that the OAuth 2.0 provider uses to sign tokens

Here is the minimal configuration to support OAuth 2.0 authentication :
:::info
To activate it in the Management plugin you need [additional configuration](./management#minimum-configuration).
:::

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = new_resource_server_id
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://my-oauth2-provider.com/realm/rabbitmq
```

Based on the previous configuration, JWT Tokens presented to RabbitMQ for authentication must:

1. be digitally signed
2. have a value in the `aud` field that matches `resource_server_id` value
3. have scopes that must match the `resource_server_id` value, for example `new_resource_server_id.read:*/*`

Also, the `https://my-oauth2-provider.com/realm/rabbitmq/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint must return the OpenID Provider Configuration which includes the JKWS URL to download the signing keys.
:::info
*.well-known/openid-configuration* is the OpenID standard path for the OpenID Provider Configuration endpoint
:::

If your provider exposes a different path and/or requires some extra http parameters for the OpenId discovery endpoint, you can configure them as follows:
```ini
auth_oauth2.discovery_endpoint_path = my/custom/path
auth_oauth2.discovery_endpoint_params.appid = some-app-id
```

More detail is included in the next section about what happens during the authentication and how to configure OAuth 2.0 beyond the basic configuration shown previously.

## Authorization Flow {#authorization-flow}

This plugin does not communicate with any OAuth 2.0 provider in order to authenticate user and grants access. Instead, it decodes an access token provided by the client and authorises a user based on the scopes found in the token.

Tokens must be digitally signed otherwise they are not accepted. RabbitMQ must have the signing key to validate the signature. You can either configure the signing keys the OAuth 2.0 provider will use, or configure RabbitMQ with one of the following two endpoints:

* **JWKS endpoint**: this is the HTTP endpoint that returns the signing keys used to digitally sign the tokens
* **OpenID Provider Configuration endpoint**: this endpoint returns the provider's configuration including all of its endpoints, most importantly the **JWKS endpoint**

When you configure RabbitMQ with one of two previous endpoints, RabbitMQ must make a HTTP request (or two, if you specify the latter endpoint) to download the signing keys. This is an operation that occurs once for any signing key not downloaded yet. When the OAuth 2.0 provider rotates the signing keys, newer tokens refer to a new signing key which RabbitMQ does not have yet which triggers another download of the newer signing keys.

The token can be any [JWT token](https://jwt.io/introduction/) which contains the `scope` and `aud` fields.

In chronological order, here is the sequence of events that occur when a client application wants to connect to one of the RabbitMQ's messaging protocols, such as AMQP:

1. The Client application requests an **access_token** from the OAuth 2.0 provider.
2. The **access token** must include **scopes** supported by RabbitMQ in the `scope` field (it is possible to use a different field for the **scopes** by setting the name of the new field in `auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key`).
3. The Client application passes the token as password when connecting to RabbitMQ's messaging protocol. **The username field is ignored**.
4. RabbitMQ validates the token's signature. To validate it, RabbitMQ must have the signing keys or download them from the JWKS endpoint as explained in earlier sections.
5. RabbitMQ validates that the token has the **audience** claim and whose value matches the `resource_server_id` (this operation can be deactivated by setting `auth_oauth2.verify_aud` to `false`).
6. RabbitMQ translates the **scopes** found in the token into RabbitMQ **permissions** (the same permissions used in the RabbitMQ's internal database).

## Variables Configurable in rabbitmq.conf {#variables-configurable}

| Key                                        | Documentation

| `auth_oauth2.scope_prefix`                 | [Configure the prefix for all scopes](#scope-prefix). The default value is `auth_oauth2.resource_server_id` followed by the dot `.` character. |
| `auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims`    | [List of the JWT claims](#preferred-username-claims) to look for the username associated with the token.
| `auth_oauth2.default_key`                  | ID of the default signing key.
| `auth_oauth2.signing_keys`                 | Paths to the [signing key files](#signing-key-files).
| `auth_oauth2.issuer`                       | The [issuer URL](#configure-issuer) of the authorization server that is used to either discover endpoints such as `jwks_uri` and/or where to redirect RabbitMQ management users to login and get a token.
| `auth_oauth2.jwks_uri`                     | The URL of the [JWKS endpoint](#jwks-endpoint). According to the [JWT Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.2), the endpoint URL must be https. Optional if you set `auth_oauth2.issuer`. If this URL is set, it overrides the `jwks_uri` discovered via the discovery endpoint.
| `auth_oauth2.jwks_url`                     | This variable is **deprecated** and you should use instead `auth_oauth2.jwks_uri`. In RabbitMQ 4.2.0, this variable will be removed. In the meantime, RabbitMQ supports it until you change your configuration.
| `auth_oauth2.token_endpoint`               | The URL of the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint. Optional if you set `auth_oauth2.issuer`. If this URL is set, it overrides the `token_endpoint` discovered via the discovery endpoint.
| `auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile`             | Path to a file containing PEM-encoded CA certificates. The CA certificates are used to connect to any of these endpoints: `jwks_uri`, `token_endpoint`, or the discovery endpoint.
| `auth_oauth2.https.depth`                  | The maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates that may follow the peer certificate in a valid [certification path](ssl#peer-verification-depth). The default value is 10.
| `auth_oauth2.https.peer_verification`      | Configures [peer verification](ssl#peer-verification). Available values: `verify_none`, `verify_peer`. The default value is `verify_peer` if there are trusted CA installed in the OS or `auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile` is set. <p/> **Deprecated**: This variable will be soon replaced by `auth_oauth2.https.verify`. Users should stop using this variable.
| `auth_oauth2.https.fail_if_no_peer_cert`   | Used together with `auth_oauth2.https.peer_verification = verify_peer`. When set to `true`, TLS connection will be rejected if the client fails to provide a certificate. The default value is `false`.
| `auth_oauth2.https.hostname_verification`  | Enable wildcard-aware hostname verification for key server. Available values: `wildcard`, `none`. The default value is `none`.
| `auth_oauth2.https.crl_check`              | [Perform CRL verification](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ssl#type-crl_check) (Certificate Revocation List) verification. Default value is false.

| `auth_oauth2.verify_aud`                   | Whether to verify the [token's `aud`](#token-validation) field or not. The default value is `true`.
| `auth_oauth2.resource_servers`             | [Multiple OAuth 2.0 resources configuration](#multiple-resource-servers-configuration).
| `auth_oauth2.oauth_providers`              | [Multiple OAuth 2.0 providers configuration](#multiple-oauth-providers-configuration).
| `auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider`       | ID of the OAuth 2.0 provider used for the `auth_oauth2.resource_servers`, that did not specify any (via the variable `oauth_provider_id`) or when `auth_oauth2.jwks_uri` and `auth_oauth2.issuer` are both missing.


## Resource Server ID {#resource-server-id}

A RabbitMQ cluster must have at least one resource server identifier configured. If it has just one resource, this is configured in the `auth_oauth2.resource_server_id` variable and it is **mandatory**.
If the RabbitMQ cluster has more than one OAuth resource then they are configured under `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.<index>` and in this case `auth_oauth2.resource_server_id` variable is not mandatory.

RabbitMQ uess the resource server identity for these two purposes:
- To validate the token's audience (`aud`) whose value must contain the resource server identifier. This validation can be disabled though.
- To initiate the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow in the Management UI. This is the flow used to authenticate a user and to get its access token. RabbitMQ must include the resource server identifier in the request's attribute called `resource`.

## Scope Prefix {#scope-prefix}

OAuth 2.0 tokens use scopes to communicate what set of permissions particular client are granted. The scopes are free form strings.

By default, `resource_server_id` followed by the dot (`.`) character is the prefix used for scopes to avoid scope collisions (or unintended overlap).
However, in some environments, it is not possible to use `resource_server_id` as the prefix for all scopes. For these environments, there is a new variable called `scope_prefix` which overrides the default scope prefix.

Given the below configuration, the scope associated with the permission `read:*/*` is `api://read:*/*`.
```ini
...
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = api://
...
```

To use an empty string as prefix, use this configuration:
```ini
...
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = ''
...
```

## Scope Aliases {#scope-aliases}

:::important

Scope aliases are necessary when scopes in the RabbitMQ format cannot be
configured on the identity provider (IDP) side

:::

A scope alias is a mapping between a custom JWT token scope and a set of RabbitMQ-specific scopes. A custom
scope can also be defined as any scope which is not recogonized by RabbitMQ's OAuth 2 subsystem.

Scope aliases are necessary when scopes in the RabbitMQ format cannot be
configured on the identity provider (IDP) side. Instead, a set of names is configured
on the IDP side, and mapped to a set of scoped that RabbitMQ can parse and use.

For instance, let's consider an identity provider with the following two roles:

* `admin`
* `developer`

These roles should be mapped to the following RabbitMQ scopes:

* `admin` to `rabbitmq.tag:administrator rabbitmq.read:*/`
* `developer` to `rabbitmq.tag:management rabbitmq.read:*/* rabbitmq.write:*/* rabbitmq.configure:*/*`

The following `rabbitmq.conf` example performs the aforementioned mapping using scope aliases. The mapping can be one-to-one or one-to-many:

```ìni
# ...
# the "admin" role above
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.admin = rabbitmq.tag:administrator rabbitmq.read:*/
# the "developer" role above
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.developer = rabbitmq.tag:management rabbitmq.read:*/* rabbitmq.write:*/* rabbitmq.configure:*/*
# ...
```

Sometimes an alias may have to use special characters and symbols including the separator character, `.`.
In those cases, configure the scope aliases as follows:

```ìni
# ...
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.1.alias = api://admin
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.1.scope = rabbitmq.tag:administrator rabbitmq.read:*/
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.2.alias = api://developer.All
auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.2.scope = rabbitmq.tag:management rabbitmq.read:*/* rabbitmq.write:*/* rabbitmq.configure:*/*
# ...
```

## Signing Keys Files {#signing-key-files}

The following configuration declares two signing keys and configures the kid of the default signing key. For more information check the section [Configure Signing keys](#configure-signing-keys).

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = new_resource_server_id
auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key = my_custom_scope_key
auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims.1 = username
auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims.2 = user_name
auth_oauth2.default_key = id1
auth_oauth2.signing_keys.id1 = test/config_schema_SUITE_data/certs/key.pem
auth_oauth2.signing_keys.id2 = test/config_schema_SUITE_data/certs/cert.pem
auth_oauth2.algorithms.1 = HS256
auth_oauth2.algorithms.2 = RS256
```

## JWKS endpoint {#jwks-endpoint}

The following configuration sets the JWKS endpoint from which RabbitMQ downloads the signing keys using the configured CA certificate and TLS variables.

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = new_resource_server_id
auth_oauth2.jwks_uri = https://my-jwt-issuer/jwks.json
auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile = test/config_schema_SUITE_data/certs/cacert.pem
auth_oauth2.https.peer_verification = verify_peer
auth_oauth2.https.depth = 5
auth_oauth2.https.fail_if_no_peer_cert = true
auth_oauth2.https.hostname_verification = wildcard
auth_oauth2.algorithms.1 = HS256
auth_oauth2.algorithms.2 = RS256
```


## Multiple Resource Servers Сonfiguration {#multiple-resource-servers-configuration}

Each `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.<id/index>.` entry has the following variables shown in the table below. Except for the variables `id` and `oauth_provider_id`, if a resource does not configure a variable, RabbitMQ uses the variable configured at the root level. For instance, if the resource `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.prod` does not configure `preferred_username_claims` variable, RabbitMQ uses the value configured in `auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims` for the resource `prod`.

| Key                          | Documentation
|------------------------------|-----------
| `id`                         | The [Resource Server ID](#resource-server-id).
| `resource_server_type`       | The Resource Server Type required when using [Rich Authorization Request](#rich-authorization-request) token format.
| `additional_scopes_key`      | Configure the plugin to look for scopes in other fields (maps to `additional_rabbitmq_scopes` in the old format).
| `scope_prefix`               | [Configure the prefix for all scopes](#scope-prefix). The default value is `auth_oauth2.resource_server_id` followed by the dot `.` character.
| `scope_aliases`              | [Configure scope aliases](#scope-aliases)
| `preferred_username_claims`  | [List of the JWT claims](#preferred-username-claims) to look for the username associated with the token separated by commas.
| `oauth_provider_id`          | The identifier of the OAuth Provider associated to this resource. RabbitMQ uses the signing keys issued by this OAuth Provider to validate tokens whose audience matches this resource's id.

All available configurable parameters for each OAuth 2 provider is documented [in a separate section](#multiple-oauth-providers-configuration).

Usually, a numeric value is used as `index`, for example `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod`. However, it can be any string, for example `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.rabbit_prod.jwks_uri = http://some_url`. By default, the `index` is the resource server's id. However, you can override it via the `id` variable like in `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod`.

Here is an example which configures two resources (`prod` and `dev`) which are used by the users and clients managed by
the same identity provider whose issuer url is `https://my-idp.com/`:

```ini
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://my-idp.com/
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = dev
```

See the advanced usage section called [Multiple Resource Servers](#multiple-resource-servers) for more information on how to configure them.

## Multiple OAuth Providers Сonfiguration {#multiple-oauth-providers-configuration}

Each `auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.{id/index}` entry has the following sub-keys.

| Key                          | Documentation
|------------------------------|-----------
| `issuer`                     | URL of OAuth Provider. It is used to build the discovery endpoint URL and/or to redirect RabbitMQ Management users to login and get a token.
| `discovery_endpoint_path`    | The path used for the OpenId discovery endpoint. Default value is `.well-known/openid-configuration`
| `discovery_endpoint_params`  | [List of HTTP query parameters](#discovery-endpoint-params) sent to the OpenId discovery endpoint.
| `token_endpoint`             | The URL of the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint. Optional if you configured `issuer`.
| `jwks_uri`                   | The URL of the [JWKS endpoint](#jwks-endpoint). According to the [JWT Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.2), the endpoint URL must be https. This variable is optional if you set `issuer`.
| `https.cacertfile`           | Path to a file containing PEM-encoded CA certificates used to connect `issuer` and/or `jwks_uri` URLs.
| `https.depth`                | The maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates that may follow the peer certificate in a valid [certification path](ssl#peer-verification-depth). The default value is 10.
| `https.verify`               | Configures [peer verification](ssl#peer-verification). Available values: `verify_none`, `verify_peer`. The default value is `verify_peer` if there are trusted CA installed in the OS or `auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile` is set.
| `https.fail_if_no_peer_cert` | Used together with `auth_oauth2.https.peer_verification = verify_peer`. When set to `true`, TLS connection will be rejected if the client fails to provide a certificate. The default value is `false`.
| `https.hostname_verification` | Enable wildcard-aware hostname verification for key server. Available values: `wildcard`, `none`. The default value is `none`.
| `https.crl_check`              | [Perform CRL verification](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ssl#type-crl_check) (Certificate Revocation List) verification. Default value is false.
| `signing_keys`               | Local filesystem paths to the [signing key files](#signing-key-files). The files must exist and be readable.
| `default_key`                | ID of the default signing key.
| `algorithms`                 | Used to restrict [the list of enabled algorithms](https://github.com/potatosalad/erlang-jose#algorithm-support).

Here is an example which configures two resources (`prod` and `dev`) where each resource is managed by two distinct identity providers:

```ini
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.oauth_provider_id = idp_prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.oauth_provider_id = idp_dev
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.idp_prod.issuer = https://idp_prod.com
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.idp_dev.issuer = https://idp_dev.com
```

See the advanced usage section called [Multiple OAuth Providers](#multiple-oauth-providers) for more information on how to configure them.

### Token validation {#token-validation}

When RabbitMQ receives a JWT token, it validates it before accepting it.

#### Must be digitally signed

The token must carry a digital signature and optionally a `kid` header attribute which identifies the key RabbitMQ should
use to validate the signature.

#### Must not be expired

RabbitMQ uses this field `exp` ([exp](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#page-9)) to validate the token if present.
It contains the expiration time after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.

#### Audience must have/match the resource_server_id

The `aud` ([Audience](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#page-9)) identifies the recipients and/or resource_server of the JWT.

By default, **RabbitMQ uses this field to validate the token**. This validation can be disabled by setting the `auth_oauth2.verify_aud` setting set to `false`.
When verification is enabled, this `aud` field must either match the `resource_server_id` value or, in case of a list, it must contain the `resource_server_id` value.

### Token expiration and refresh {#token-expiration}

In RabbitMQ, token expiration and refresh processes vary between AMQP 1.0 and AMQP 0.9.1 protocols.

For **AMQP 1.0**, if the latest token on an existing connection expires, RabbitMQ disconnects the client.
To prevent disconnection, the client should proactively refresh the token before it expires.
The client can set a new token by sending an [HTTP over AMQP 1.0](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/amqp-specs/blob/master/http-over-amqp-v1.0-wd06a.docx) request.
This request should use a `PUT` operation to the `/auth/tokens` endpoint, with the token included in the body as a [binary](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-binary) [AMQP value](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-amqp-value).
Token refresh is supported by RabbitMQ’s AMQP 1.0 clients in [Java](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp-java-client), [.NET](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp-dotnet-client), and [Erlang](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/main/deps/rabbitmq_amqp_client).

In the case of **AMQP 0.9.1**, when a token expires on an existing connection, the broker will refuse further operations after a limited time, but it will not disconnect the client.
To refresh the token, the client should use the AMQP 0.9.1 [update-secret](/amqp-0-9-1-reference#connection.update-secret) method if supported by the client (for example, see the [Java client](/client-libraries/java-api-guide#oauth2-refreshing-token) documentation).
If the client does not support `update-secret`, it must disconnect and reconnect with a new token.

### Scope-to-Permission translation {#scope-translation}

Scopes are translated into permission grants to RabbitMQ resources for the provided token.

The current scope format is `<permission>:<vhost_pattern>/<name_pattern>[/<routing_key_pattern>]` where

 * `<permission>` is an access permission (`configure`, `read`, or `write`)
 * `<vhost_pattern>` is a wildcard pattern for vhosts token has access to.
 * `<name_pattern>` is a wildcard pattern for resource name
 * `<routing_key_pattern>` is a wildcard pattern for routing key in topic authorization

Wildcard patterns are strings with optional wildcard symbols `*` that match
any sequence of characters.

Wildcard patterns match as following:

 * `*` matches any string
 * `foo*` matches any string starting with a `foo`
 * `*foo` matches any string ending with a `foo`
 * `foo*bar` matches any string starting with a `foo` and ending with a `bar`

There can be multiple wildcards in a pattern:

 * `start*middle*end`
 * `*before*after*`

**To use special characters like `*`, `%`, or `/` in a wildcard pattern,
the pattern must be [URL-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).**

These are the usually permissions examples:

- `read:*/*`(`read:*/*/*`) - read permissions to any resource on any vhost
- `write:*/*`(`write:*/*/*`) - write permissions to any resource on any vhost
- `read:vhost1/*`(`read:vhost1/*/*`) - read permissions to any resource on the `vhost1` vhost
- `read:vhost1/some*` - read permissions to all the resources, starting with `some` on the `vhost1` vhost
- `write:vhost1/some*/routing*` - topic write permissions to publish to an exchange starting with `some` with a routing key starting with `routing`
- `read:*/*/*` and `write:*/*/*` - queue binding permissions required to bind a queue on a topic exchange with any routing key

See the [wildcard matching test suite](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2/test/wildcard_match_SUITE.erl) and [scopes test suite](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2/test/scope_SUITE.erl) for more examples.

Scopes, by default, are prefixed with `resource_server_id` followed by the dot (`.`) character if `scope_prefix`
is not configured. For example, if `resource_server_id` is "my_rabbit", a scope to enable read from any vhost will
be `my_rabbit.read:*/*`.

If `scope_prefix` is configured then scopes are prefixed as follows: `<scope_prefix><permission>`. For example,
if `scope_prefix` is `api://` and the permission is `read:*/*` the scope would be `api://read:*/*`

### Topic Exchange scopes {#topic-exchange-scopes}

The [previous](#scope-translation) section explained, in detail, how permissions are mapped to scopes. This section explains more specifically what scopes you need in order to operate on **Topic Exchanges**.

To bind and/or unbind a queue to/from a **Topic Exchange**, you need to have the following scopes:

- **write** permission on the queue and routing key -> `rabbitmq.write:<vhost>/<queue>/<routingkey>`
> for example `rabbitmq.write:*/*/*`

- **read** permission on the exchange and routing key -> `rabbitmq.write:<vhost>/<exchange>/<routingkey>`
> for example `rabbitmq.read:*/*/*`

To publish to a **Topic Exchange**, you need to have the following scope:

- **write** permission on the exchange and routing key -> `rabbitmq.write:<vhost>/<exchange>/<routingkey>`
> for example `rabbitmq.write:*/*/*`

OAuth 2.0 authorisation backend supports variable expansion when checking permission on topics.
It supports JWT claims whose value is a plain string, plus the `vhost` variable.

For example, a user connected with the token below to the vhost `prod` should have
a write permission on all exchanges starting with `x-prod-`, and any routing key starting with `u-bob-`:

```json
{
  "sub" : "bob",
  "scope" : [ "rabbitmq.write:*/x-{vhost}-*/u-{sub}-*" ]
}
```


### Scope and tags {#scope-and-tags}

Users in RabbitMQ can have [tags associated with them](./access-control#user-tags).
Tags are used to [control access to the management plugin](./management#permissions).

In the OAuth context, tags can be added as part of the scope, using a format like `<resource_server_id>.tag:<tag>`. For example, if the `resource_server_id` is "my_rabbit", a scope to grant access to the management plugin with
the `monitoring` tag will be `my_rabbit.tag:monitoring`.

## Basic usage {#basic-usage}

### Configure OAuth 2.0 provider's issuer {#configure-issuer}

Before RabbitMQ 3.13, users had to either configure the JWKS endpoint (that is `auth_oauth2.jwks_uri` variable) or statically [configure the signing keys](#configure-signing-keys). Now, users only need to configure the OpenID Provider's **issuer** URL and from this URL RabbitMQ downloads the OpenID Provider configuration which includes the JWKS endpoint in addition to other endpoints which will be useful in other contexts.

Usually, this **issuer** URL is the same URL configured in the management plugin (`management.oauth_provider_url`). From now on, you only need to configure a single URL, specified by the `auth_oauth2.issuer` variable. Except in edge cases where the **issuer** URL does not host the login page. In those cases, the user configures the login page in the `management.oauth_provider_url` variable.

Sample configuration using issuer:
```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = my_rabbit_server
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://my-idp-provider/somerealm
```

Sample configuration which configures the `jwks_uri` rather than the issuer:
```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = my_rabbit_server
auth_oauth2.jwks_uri = "https://my-jwt-issuer/jwks.json
```

:::info
If you have both endpoints configured, RabbitMQ uses `jwks_uri` because it does not need to discover it via the `issuer` url.
:::

:::info
**Note about TLS variables for the `jwks_uri` or the `issuer` url**: TLS variable such as the `cacertfile` are configured as follows regardless which url you are using:
:::

```ini
...
auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/cacert.pem
...
```

**VERY IMPORTANT**: Since RabbitMQ 3.13, if `auth_oauth2.https.peer_verification` variable is not set, RabbitMQ sets it to `verify_peer` as long as there are trusted certificates installed in the OS or the user configured `auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile`.

### Configure signing keys {#configure-signing-keys}

Currently, it is very rare you configure RabbitMQ with signing keys, when RabbitMQ can automatically download them as explained in the previous section. However, RabbitMQ supports those edge cases where you need to statically configure the signing keys, or when you need to support symmetric signing keys as opposed to the most widely used asymmetric keys.

The following example uses [Cloud Foundry UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) as the OAuth 2.0 provider.

To get the signing key from the [OAuth 2.0 provider UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa), use the
[token_key endpoint](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/4.6.0/index.html#token-key-s)
or [uaac](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac) (the `uaac signing key` command).

The following fields are required: `kty`, `value`, `alg`, and `kid`.

Assuming UAA reports the following signing key information:

```erlang
uaac signing key
  kty: RSA
  e: AQAB
  use: sig
  kid: a-key-ID
  alg: RS256
  value: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

```

it translates into the following configuration (in the [advanced RabbitMQ config format](./configure)):

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = my_rabbit_server
auth_oauth2.signing_keys.a-key-ID = /path-to-signing-key-pem-file
```

If a symmetric key is used, the configuration looks like this:

```erlang
[
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
    {resource_server_id, <<"my_rabbit_server">>},
    {key_config, [
      {signing_keys, #{
        <<"a-key-ID">> => {map, #{<<"kty">> => <<"MAC">>,
                                  <<"alg">> => <<"HS256">>,
                                  <<"value">> => <<"my_signing_key">>}}
      }}
    ]}
  ]},
].
```

### Use a different token field for the scope {#use-different-token-field}

By default the plugin looks for the `scope` key in the token, you can configure the plugin to also look in other fields using the `extra_scopes_source` variable. Values format accepted are scope as **string** or **list**

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = my_rabbit_server
auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key = my_custom_scope_key
```

Token sample:
```ini
{
 "exp": 1618592626,
 "iat": 1618578226,
 "aud" : ["my_id"],
 ...
 "scope_as_string": "my_id.configure:*/* my_id.read:*/* my_id.write:*/*",
 "scope_as_list": ["my_id.configure:*/*", "my_id.read:*/*", "my_id.write:*/*"],
 ...
 }
```

### Preferred username claims {#preferred-username-claims}

The username associated with the token must be available to RabbitMQ so that this username is displayed in the RabbitMQ Management UI.
By default, RabbitMQ searches for the `sub` claim first, and if it is not found, RabbitMQ uses the `client_id`.

Most authorization servers return the user's GUID in the `sub` claim instead of the user's username or email address, anything the user can relate to. When the `sub` claim does not carry a *user-friendly username*, you can configure one or several claims to extract the username from the token.

Example `rabbitmq.conf` configuration:

``` ini
# ...
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq
auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims.1 = user_name
auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims.2 = email
# ...
```

In the example configuration, RabbitMQ searches for the `user_name` claim first and if it is not found, RabbitMQ searches for the `email`. If these are not found, RabbitMQ uses its default lookup mechanism which first looks for `sub` and then `client_id`.


### Discovery endpoint parameters {#discovery-endpoint-params}

Some OAuth 2.0 providers requires certain query parameters in the OpenId Discovery endpoint. For instance, Microsoft Entra ID requires a query parameter called `appid` when the application uses custom signing keys. The discovery endpoint returns an OpenId configuration tailored for the application that matches the `appid`.
For instance, the `jkws_uri` endpoint returned in the OpenId configuration has already the query parameters sent to the discovery endpoint.

Here is an example of setting these parameters including the rest of the variables used to build the OpenId discovery endpoint URL.

``` ini
# ...
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://myissuer.com/v2
auth_oauth2.discovery_endpoint_path = .well-known/authorization-server
auth_oauth2.discovery_endpoint_params.param1 = value1
auth_oauth2.discovery_endpoint_params.param2 = value2
# ...
```

This is the URL built to access the OpenId Discovery endpoint:
```
https://myissuer.com/v2/.well-known/authorization-server?param1=value1&param2=value2
```

### Rich Authorization Request {#rich-authorization-request}

The [Rich Authorization Request](https://oauth.net/2/rich-authorization-requests/) extension provides a way for
OAuth clients to request fine-grained permissions during an authorization request.
It moves away from the concept of scopes that are text labels and instead
defines a more sophisticated permission model.

RabbitMQ supports JWT tokens compliant with the extension. Below is a sample example section of JWT token:

```javascript
{
  "authorization_details": [
    {
      "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance/vhost:production-*"],
      "actions": [ "read", "write", "configure"  ]
    },
    {
      "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance", "cluster:inventory" ],
      "actions": ["administrator" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The token above contains two permissions under the attribute `authorization_details`.
Both permissions are meant for RabbitMQ servers with `resource_server_type` set to `rabbitmq`.
This field identifies RabbitMQ-specific permissions.

The first permission grants `read`, `write` and `configure` permissions to any
queue and/or exchange on any virtual host whose name matches the pattern `production-*`,
and that reside in clusters whose `resource_server_id` contains the string `finance`.
The `cluster` attribute's value is also a regular expression. To match exactly the
string `finance`, use `^finance$`.

The second permission grants the `administrator` user tag in two clusters, `finance`
and `inventory`. Other supported user tags as `management`, `policymaker` and `monitoring`.


#### Type field

In order for a RabbitMQ node to accept a permission, its value must match that
node's `resource_server_type` variable's value. A JWT token may have permissions
for multiple resource types.

#### Locations field

The `locations` field can be either a string containing a single location or a Json array containing
zero or many locations.

A location consists of a list of key-value pairs separated by forward slash `/` character. Here is the format:
```bash
cluster:<resource_server_id_pattern>[/vhost:<vhost_pattern>][/queue:<queue_name_pattern>|/exchange:<exchange_name_pattern>][/routing-key:<routing_key_pattern>]
```

Any string separated by `/` which does not conform to `<key>:<value>` is ignored. For instance, if your locations start with a prefix, for example `vrn/cluster:rabbitmq`, the `vrn` pattern part is ignored.

The supported location's attributed are:

- `cluster`: This is the only mandatory attribute. It is a wildcard pattern which must match RabbitMQ's `resource_server_id` otherwise the location is ignored.
- `vhost`: This is the virtual host you are granting access to. It also a wildcard pattern. If not specified, `*` will be used.
- `queue`|`exchange`: queue or exchange name pattern. The location grants the permission to a set of queues (or exchanges) that match it. One location can only specify either `queue` or `exchange` but not both. If not specified, `*` will be used
- `routing-key`: this is the routing key pattern the location grants the permission to. If not specified, `*` will be used

For more information about wildcard patterns, check the section [Scope-to-Permission Translation](#scope-translation).

#### Actions field

The `actions` field can be either a string containing a single action or a Json array containing zero or many actions.

The supported actions map to either [RabbitMQ permissions](./access-control#authorisation):

- `configure`
- `read`
- `write`

Or RabbitMQ user tags:

- `administrator`
- `monitoring`
- `management`
- `policymaker`

#### Rich-Permission to scope translation

Rich Authorization Request permissions are translated into JWT token scopes that use the
aforementioned convention using the following algorithm:

For each location found in the `locations` where the `cluster` attribute matches the current RabbitMQ server's `resource_server_id`:

  - For each location found in the `locations` field where the `cluster` attribute matches the current RabbitMQ node's `resource_server_id`, the plugin extracts the `vhost`, `queue` or `exchange` and `routing_key` attributes from the location. If the location does not  have any of those attributes, the default value of `*` is assumed. Out of those values, the following scope suffix will be produced:
    ```ini
    scope_suffix = <vhost>/<queue>|<exchange>/<routing-key>
    ```

  - For each action found in the `actions` field:

    if the action is not a known user tag, the following scope is produced out of it:
    ```ini
      scope = <resource_server_id>.<action>:<scope_suffix>
    ```

    For known user tag actions, the following scope is produced:
    ```ini
      scope = <resource_server_id>.<action>
    ```


The plugin produces permutations of all `actions` by  all `locations` that match the node's configured `resource_server_id`.

In the following RAR example
```javascript
{
  "authorization_details": [
    { "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance/vhost:primary-*"],
      "actions": [ "read", "write", "configure"  ]
    },
    { "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance", "cluster:inventory" ],
      "actions": ["administrator" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

if RabbitMQ nodes `resource_server_id` is equal to `finance`, the plugin computes the following sets of scopes:

- `finance.read:primary-*/*/*`
- `finance.write:primary-*/*/*`
- `finance.configure:primary-*/*/*`
- `finance.tag:administrator`



## Advanced usage {#advanced-usage}

### Use default OAuth 2.0 provider {#use-oauth-provider}

As long as you have only one OAuth 2.0 provider, you can skip this advanced usage although you can use it.

Under the [basic usage](#configure-issuer) section, you configured the `issuer` url or maybe the `jwks_uri` along with the TLS variables if needed. This advanced usage configures everything relative to the OAuth provider into a dedicated configuration.

Here is an example configuration that uses `issuer` to configure the identity provider's URL:

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq-prod
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod
auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/prodcacert.pem
```

The equivalent configuration where the identity provider is configured under `auth_oauth2.oauth_providers` variable is:

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq-prod
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider = prodkeycloak

auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prodkeycloak.issuer = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prodkeycloak.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/prodcacert.pem
```

This latter configuration is more relevant when users present tokens which are issued or signed by different OAuth 2.0 providers. However, one can still use it provided `auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider` is set.

### Configure OAuth 2.0 provider's end_session_endpoint {#configure-end-session-endpoint}

This advanced setting is only required when the [OpenId Connect Discovery endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationRequest) does not return an `end_session_endpoint` and you want Single Logout functionality. In other words, when the user logs out from the management UI it is also logged out from the OAuth Provider.

:::info
If the [OpenId Connect Discovery endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationRequest) response does include an `end_session_endpoint`,
the management UI uses it over the configured endpoint.
:::

Here is an example configuration that sets `end_session_endpoint`:

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq-prod
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod
auth_oauth2.end_session_endpoint = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod/logout
```

The equivalent configuration where the identity provider is configured under `auth_oauth2.oauth_providers` variable is:

```ini
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq-prod
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider = prodkeycloak

auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prodkeycloak.issuer = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prodkeycloak.end_session_endpoint = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod/logout
```

### Configure multiple resource servers {#multiple-resource-servers}

Usually, all users that access a RabbitMQ cluster are registered within the same identity provider. Likewise, all tokens targeting the same RabbitMQ cluster also carry the same *audience*. In other words, all users reference a RabbitMQ cluster with the same resource name which must match the value of the `auth_oauth2.resource_server_id` variable.

However, there are some use-cases where RabbitMQ is accessed by users registered in different identity providers or tokens are issued for the same RabbitMQ installation but with different *Audience*(s). For these use-cases, RabbitMQ OAuth 2.0 plugin and the Management plugin can be configured with multiple OAuth 2.0 resources.

The following is the OAuth 2.0 plugin configuration for two resources with the ids: `rabbit_prod` and `rabbit_dev`. Both resources (also known as *audience*) are managed by the same Identity Provider whose issuer is `http//some_idp_url`.

```ini
auth_oauth2.issuer = http//some_idp_url
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.

auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = rabbit_dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.scope_prefix = dev-rabbitmq.
```

All resource servers share the variables you set so far under `auth_oauth2.` such as `scope_prefix`. However, they can override them. Here are the list of variables a resource server can override:
- `id` - This is the actual resource identifier carried in the `audience` field of a token. If omitted, the value is the index, for example, given `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.prod.scope_prefix` variable, the `id` would be `prod`.
- `scope_prefix`
- `additional_scopes_key`
- `resource_server_type`
- `oauth_provider_id` - This is the identifier of the OAuth provider. It is configured in RabbitMQ. It provides all the variables to contact the authorization server and discover all its endpoints, such as the `jwks_uri` to download the signing keys to validate the token. If this variable is omitted, RabbitMQ looks up the default Authorization Provider's id in the variable `auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider`, and if it is also omitted, RabbitMQ uses `auth_oauth2.issuer` or `auth_oauth2.jwks_uri` to download the signings keys to validate the token.

The list of supported resource servers is the combination of `auth_oauth2.resource_servers` and `auth_oauth2.resource_server_id`. You can use both or only one of them.

:::info

There is an [example](./oauth2-examples-multiresource) that demonstrate how to use multiple OAuth 2 resources.

:::

A list of [all the configurable variables](#multiple-resource-servers-configuration) for
each OAuth Provider is documented in a separate section.

### Configure multiple OAuth 2.0 providers {#multiple-oauth-providers}

It only makes sense to set multiple OAuth 2.0 providers if there are [multiple resources configured](#multiple-resource-servers).

This is the configuration used in the previous section but modified to use multiple OAuth 2.0 providers:

```ini
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.

auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.oauth_provider_id = prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = rabbit_dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.oauth_provider_id = dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.scope_prefix = dev-rabbitmq.

auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prod.issuer = https://rabbit_prod:8080
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prod.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/prod.pem
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.dev.issuer = https://rabbit_dev:8080
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.dev.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/dev.pem
```

A list of [all the configurable variables](#multiple-resource-servers-configuration) for
each OAuth Provider is documented in a separate section.

## Examples {#examples}

The [RabbitMQ OAuth 2.0 Auth backend examples](./oauth2-examples) contain many example configuration files, that can be used to set up several OAuth 2.0 providers, including UAA, Auth0, and Azure, and issue tokens, which can be used to access RabbitMQ resources.

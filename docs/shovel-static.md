# Configuring Static Shovels

## Overview {#overview}

This guide focuses on statically configured shovels. It assumes
familiarity with the key concepts behind the [Shovel plugin](./shovel).

Unlike with [dynamic shovels](./shovel-dynamic), static shovels are configured using the [advanced configuration file](./configure).
They are started on node boot and are primarily useful for permanently
running workloads. Any changes to static shovel configuration would require
a node restart, which makes them highly inflexible.

Most users **should prefer dynamic shovels** to static ones for their flexibility
and ease of automation. Generating a dynamic shovel definition (a JSON document) is usually
easier compared to a static shovel definition (which uses Erlang terms).


## Configuration {#configuration}

The configuration for the Shovel plugin must be defined in the
[advanced configuration file](./configure#advanced-config-file).

It consists of a single `shovels` clause that lists the shovels that should
be started on node boot:

```erlang
{rabbit, [
  %% ...
]},

{rabbitmq_shovel, [
  {shovels, [
    {shovel_one, [
      %% shovel_one properties ...
    ]},
    %% ...
  ]}
]}
```

A (deliberately verbose) [example configuration](#example-config) can be found below.

Each element of the `shovels` clause is a named static shovel.
The names in the list must be distinct.

A shovel definition looks like this at the top level:

```erlang
{shovel_name, [
  {source, [
    %% protocol-specific source configuration goes here
  ]},
  {destination, [
    %% protocol-specific destination configuration goes here
  ]},
  %% 'confirm' is the default acknowledgement mode
  {ack_mode, confirm},
  %% reconnect with a 5 second delay
  {reconnect_delay, 5}
]}
```

where <code><em>shovel_name</em></code> is the name of the
shovel (an Erlang atom). The name should be enclosed in single quotes (`'`) if they do
not begin with a lower-case letter or if they contain
other characters than alphanumeric characters, underscore
(`_`), or `@`.

### The Source and The Destination

A shovel transfers messages from a source to a destination.

The `source` and `destination` keys are **mandatory** and contain nested protocol-specific keys. Currently AMQP 0.9.1 and AMQP 1.0 are two supported protocols.
Source and destination do not have to use the same protocol.
All the other properties are optional.

`source` is a mandatory key and has different keys properties
for different protocols. Two properties are common across all
protocols: `protocol` and `uris`.
`protocol` supports two values: `amqp091` and `amqp10`,
for AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0, respectively:

```erlang
%% for AMQP 0-9-1
{protocol, amqp091}
```

`uris` is a list of <a href="./uri-spec">AMQP connection URIs</a>:

```erlang
{uris, [
        "amqp://fred:secret@host1.domain/my_vhost",
        "amqp://john:secret@host2.domain/my_vhost"
       ]}
```

The URI syntax is extended to include a query part to
permit the configuration of additional connection parameters.
See the [query parameter reference](./uri-query-parameters) which
are available to static shovels, such as TLS certificate and private key.

### General Source Keys

Some keys are supported by both AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0 sources.
They are described in the table below.

<table>
  <caption>Common (Protocol-Independent) Static Shovel Keys (Properties)</caption>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Key</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>reconnect-delay</td>
      <td>
        The duration (in seconds) to wait before reconnecting to the
        brokers after being disconnected at either end. Default is 1.

```erlang
{reconnect_delay, 5}
```
        would delay for five seconds before reconnecting after failure. Value of `0`
        means no reconnection: the shovel will stop after first failure or unsuccessful
        connection attempt.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ack-mode</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Determines how the shovel should <a href="./confirms">acknowledge</a> consumed messages.
          Valid values are <code>on-confirm</code>, <code>on-publish</code>, and <code>no-ack</code>.
          <code>on-confirm</code> is used by default.
        </p>
        <p>
          If set to <code>on-confirm</code> (the default), messages are
          <a href="./confirms">acknowledged</a> to the source broker after they have been confirmed
          by the destination. This handles network errors and broker
          failures without losing messages, and is the slowest option.
        </p>
        <p>
          If set to <code>on-publish</code>, messages are <a href="./confirms">acknowledged</a> to
          the source broker after they have been published at the
          destination (but not yet confirmed). Messages may be lost in the event of network or broker failures.
        </p>
        <p>
          If set to <code>no-ack</code>, <a href="./confirms">automatic message acknowledgements</a> will be used.
          This option will offer the highest throughput but is not safe (will lose messages in the event of network or broker failures).
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### AMQP 0-9-1 Source Keys

AMQP 0-9-1-specific source keys are covered in a separate table:

<table>
  <caption>AMQP 0-9-1 Source Keys (Properties)</caption>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Key</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>declarations</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          An optional list of AMQP 0-9-1 operations to be executed by the Shovel
          before it starts transferring messages. They are typically used to set
          up the topology.
        </p>
```erlang
  {declarations, [
    %% declaration list
  ]}
```
        <p>
          The declarations follow method and property names used by the <a href="/client-libraries/erlang-client-user-guide">RabbitMQ Erlang Client</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A minimalistic declaration example:
        </p>
```erlang
  {declarations, [
                   'queue.declare',
                   {'queue.bind', [
                                    {exchange, <<"my_exchange">>},
                                    {queue,    <<>>}
                                  ]}
                 ]}
```
        <p>
          will first declare an anonymous queue, and then bind it
          to the exchange called <code>"my_exchange"</code>. The
          queue name of <code>&lt;&lt;>></code> on method <code>queue.bind</code>
          means "use the queue last declared on this channel".
        </p>
        <p>
          Each element of the declaration list is either an AMQP 0-9-1 method
          given as single quoted atom such as <code>'queue.declare'</code>,
          or a tuple with first element the method atom, and second element
          a property list of parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          If just the method name is used all the
          parameters take their defaults (as illustrated with
          <code>'queue.declare'</code> above).
        </p>
        <p>
          If a tuple and property-list is supplied, then the
          properties in the list specify some or all of the
          parameters explicitly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is another example:
        </p>
```erlang
{'exchange.declare', [
                      {exchange, <<"my_exchange">>},
                      {type, <<"direct">>},
                      durable
                     ]}
```
        <p>
          will declare a durable, direct exchange called
          "<code>my_exchange</code>".
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>queue</td>
      <td>
          <p>
            The name of the source queue as an Erlang binary value. This property is mandatory:

```erlang
{queue, <<"queue.1">>}
```
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>queue.1</code> is the name of the queue
            to shovel messages from, as a binary string.
          </p>
          <p>
            This queue must exist. Use the resource <code>declarations</code>
            covered above to declare the queue or ensure it exists. If
            the value is <code>&lt;&lt;>></code> (the empty binary string) then the
            <em>most recently declared queue</em> in <code>declarations</code> is used.
            This allows anonymous queues to be declared and used.

            See also [Predeclared topology section](#predeclared-topology) below.
          </p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>prefetch-count</td>
      <td>
        The maximum number of unacknowledged messages copied over a shovel at
        any one time. Default is <code>1000</code>:

```erlang
{prefetch_count, 1000}
```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Predeclared topology {#predeclared-topology}

The `declarations` attribute is typically used to set up the topology. At the very least, it must set up the source queue.

There are deployment scenarios where the topology is automatically [imported from a definitions file at boot time](./definitions#import-on-boot). In these scenarios, we can configure the plugin to wait until the queue is available by adding the following line to the `rabbitmq.conf` file:
```ini
shovel.topology.predeclared = true
```

With the above configuration, if a static shovel has no `declarations` attribute or it is empty, the piugin will wait until the source's `queue` is eventually declared.

### AMQP 1.0 Source Keys

AMQP 1.0 source settings are different from those of AMQP 0-9-1 sources.

<table>
  <caption>AMQP 1.0 Source Keys (Properties)</caption>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Key</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>source_address</td>
      <td>
        This represents the source address of the AMQP 1.0 link.
        This key is mandatory:

```erlang
{source_address, <<"my-address">>}
```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>prefetch-count</td>
      <td>
        This optional key sets the link credit amount that will
        be granted to the receiving link. The credit will be automatically
        renewed when it falls below a 10th of this value. The default is 1000.
        It takes the form

```erlang
  {prefetch_count, 10}
```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Destination

`destination` is a mandatory key and has different keys properties
for different protocols. Two properties are common across all
protocols: `protocol` and `uris`.
`protocol` supports two values: `amqp091` and `amqp10`,
for AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0, respectively:

```erlang
%% for AMQP 0-9-1
{protocol, amqp091}
```

`uris` is a list of <a href="./uri-spec">AMQP connection URIs</a>:

```erlang
{uris, [
        "amqp://fred:secret@host1.domain/my_vhost",
        "amqp://john:secret@host2.domain/my_vhost"
       ]}
```

The URI syntax is extended to include a query part to
permit the configuration of additional connection parameters.
See the [query parameter reference](./uri-query-parameters) which
are available to static shovels, such as TLS certificate and private key.

### General Destination Keys

<table>
  <caption>General Destination Keys (Properties)</caption>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Key</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>reconnect-delay</td>
      <td>
        The duration (in seconds) to wait before reconnecting to the
        brokers after being disconnected at either end. Default is 1.

```erlang
{reconnect_delay, 5}
```
        would delay for five seconds before reconnecting after failure. Value of `0`
        means no reconnection: the shovel will stop after first failure or unsuccessful
        connection attempt.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>publish_properties</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          This optional key controls <a href="./publishers#message-properties">message properties</a>
          set or overridden by the shovel. It takes the following form
        </p>
```erlang
{publish_properties, [
  {delivery_mode, 2}
]}
```
          <p>
            where the properties in the list are set on the
            basic properties of each message before it is re-published.
          </p>
          <p>
            This specific example would mark all re-published messages as persistent:
          </p>
```erlang
{publish_properties, [
  {delivery_mode, 2}
]}
```
          <p>
            By default the original properties of the message are preserved, but
            this clause can be used to change or set any known property:

            <ul>
              <li><code>content_type</code></li>
              <li><code>content_encoding</code></li>

            This optional key is similar to <code>publish_properties</code> but controls the publishing settings
            instead of message properties that are accessible to consumers. It takes the form of
          </p>
```erlang
{publish_fields, [

            used to re-publish messages.
          </p>

## Example Configuration {#example-config}

A reasonably complete static shovel configuration between AMQP 0.9.1 endpoints
might look like this:

```erlang
{rabbitmq_shovel,
  [ {shovels, [ {my_first_shovel,
                  [ {source,
                      [ {protocol, amqp091},
                        {uris, [ "amqp://fred:secret@host1.domain/my_vhost",
                                  "amqp://john:secret@host2.domain/my_vhost" ]},
                        {declarations, [ {'exchange.declare',
                                            [ {exchange, <<"my_fanout">>},

                                            ]},
                                          {'queue.declare',

                          ]},
                    {ack_mode, on_confirm},
                    {reconnect_delay, 5}
                  ]}
              ]}
  ]}
```

The configuration above defines a single shovel called
`'my_first_shovel'`.

`'my_first_shovel'` will connect to a broker on
either `host1` or `host2` (as source), and
directly to the local broker as destination. It will reconnect
to the other source broker on failure, after a delay of 5
seconds.

When connected to the source it will declare a direct, fanout exchange
called `"my_fanout"`, an anonymous queue with a [per-queue message ttl](./ttl#per-queue-message-ttl),
and bind the queue to the exchange.

When connected to the destination (the local broker) it will declare a
durable, direct exchange called `"my_direct"`.

This shovel will re-publish messages sent to the anonymous queue on the
source to the local exchange with the fixed routing key
`"from_shovel"`. The messages will be persistent and only
acknowledged after receiving a publish confirm from the local broker.

The shovel consumer will not get more deliveries if there are at least ten
unacknowledged messages at any moment in time.


## Example Configuration (1.0 Source - 0.9.1 Destination) {#example-config-amqp10-amqp091}

A reasonably complete shovel configuration between an AMQP 1.0 source and an
AMQP 0.9.1 destination might look like this:

```erlang
{rabbitmq_shovel,
 [ {shovels, [ {my_first_shovel,
                [ {source,
                   [ {protocol, amqp10},
                     {uris, [ "amqp://fred:secret@host1.domain/my_vhost",
                            ]},
                     {source_address, <<"my-source">>},
                     {prefetch_count, 10}
                   ]},
                  {destination,
                     [ {protocol, amqp091},
                       {uris, ["amqp://"]},
                       {declarations, [ {'exchange.declare',
                                         [ {exchange, <<"my_direct">>},

                                      ]},
                       {publish_properties, [ {delivery_mode, 2} ]},
                       {add_forward_headers, true},
                       {publish_fields, [ {exchange, <<"my_direct">>},
                                          {routing_key, <<"from_shovel">>}
                                        ]}
                     ]},
                  {ack_mode, on_confirm},
                  {reconnect_delay, 5}
                ]}
             ]}
 ]}
```


## Example Configuration (0.9.1 Source — 1.0 Destination) {#example-config-amqp091-amqp10}

A more extensive shovel configuration between an AMQP 0.9.1 Source and an
AMQP 1.0 destination might look like this:

              {destination,
               [{protocol, amqp10},

                % {uris, ["amqp://user:pass@host:5672?sasl=plain"]},
                %% Note: this relies on default user credentials

                {uris, ["amqp://host:5672"]},
                {properties, [{user_id, <<"my-user">>}]},
                {application_properties, [{<<"my-prop">>, <<"my-prop-value">>}]},
                {add_forward_headers, true},

             }]}
 ]}
}
```

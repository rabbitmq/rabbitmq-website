# Intercepting Messages

## Overview

RabbitMQ provides a generic mechanism to intercept messages on the broker.
Interception can occur at two stages:
1. **Incoming messages** – intercepted when a message enters RabbitMQ, just before it is routed to [queues](./queues).
2. **Outgoing messages** – intercepted when RabbitMQ delivers a message to a client, just before it is [converted](./conversions) to the target protocol.

Interceptors are executed by one of the following [Erlang processes](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/ref_man_processes.html):
* AMQP 1.0 session
* AMQP 0.9.1 [channel](./channels)
* MQTT connection

Messages sent over the [RabbitMQ Streams protocol](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbitmq_stream/docs/PROTOCOL.adoc) are not intercepted.

A message interceptor is an [Erlang module](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/modules.html) that implements the [rabbit_msg_interceptor](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbit/src/rabbit_msg_interceptor.erl) behaviour.
What the interceptor does is entirely up to its implementation - it can validate message metadata, add annotations, or perform arbitrary side effects.

Custom interceptors can be developed and integrated via [plugins](./plugins).

RabbitMQ ships with several built-in message interceptors.
Below are examples of how to configure them using the [rabbitmq.conf](./configure#config-file) file.

## Incoming Message Interceptors

### Timestamp

This interceptor adds a timestamp to each incoming message:

```ini
message_interceptors.incoming.set_header_timestamp.overwrite = true
```

* AMQP 1.0 and Streams clients receive a message annotation: `x-opt-rabbitmq-received-time` (timestamp in milliseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC).
* AMQP 0.9.1 clients receive:
    * `timestamp_in_ms` header (milliseconds) for compatibility with the former [Message Timestamp Plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-message-timestamp)
    * `timestamp` property (seconds)

To preserve an existing `timestamp_in_ms` header, set `overwrite` to `false`:
```ini
message_interceptors.incoming.set_header_timestamp.overwrite = false
```

### Routing Node

This interceptor adds a message annotation `x-routed-by` indicating which RabbitMQ [node](./clustering#node-names) received and routed the message:
```ini
message_interceptors.incoming.set_header_routing_node.overwrite = true
```

Set `overwrite` to `false` to preserve an existing value:
```ini
message_interceptors.incoming.set_header_routing_node.overwrite = false
```

### MQTT client ID

If the [MQTT plugin](./mqtt) is enabled, RabbitMQ can annotate incoming messages with the [client ID](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901059) of the publishing MQTT client.
This is done by adding a message annotation with the key `x-opt-mqtt-client-id`.

```init
mqtt.message_interceptors.incoming.set_client_id_annotation.enabled = true
```

This annotation is visible to AMQP 1.0, AMQP 0.9.1, and Streams consumers.
However, MQTT clients will not receive this annotation, as the MQTT spec does not allow arbitrary broker-added annotations.

## Outgoing Message Interceptors

### Timestamp

This interceptor timestamps messages when they are sent to clients:

```ini
message_interceptors.outgoing.timestamp.enabled = true
```

The annotation key is `x-opt-rabbitmq-sent-time`, and its value is a timestamp in milliseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC.

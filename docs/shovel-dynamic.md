# Configuring Dynamic Shovels

## Overview {#overview}

This guide focuses on dynamically configured shovels. It assumes
familiarity with the key concepts behind the [Shovel plugin](./shovel).

Unlike with static shovels, dynamic shovels are configured using [runtime parameters](./parameters).
They can be started and stopped at any time, including programmatically. Dynamic shovels
can be used for both transient (one-off) and permanently running workloads.

Information about dynamic shovels is stored in RabbitMQ's schema database,
along with users, permissions, queues, etc. They therefore can be
exported together with other [schema definitions](./definitions) in combination
with the [pre-declared topology mode](#predeclared-topology).


## Configuration {#configuration}

Parameters can be defined using [`rabbitmqctl`](./cli), through the
[management HTTP API](./management), or (with the `rabbitmq_shovel_management` plugin [enabled](./plugins)) through
the management UI's administrative section.

A shovel is declared with a definition body, which is a JSON object. Some keys are mandatory, others are optional.
They control connection parameters, protocol used, message transfer source and destination,
[data safety](./confirms) protocol features, and more.

Every shovel belongs to a virtual host. Note that a Shovel can consume from and publish
to not only a different virtual host but an entirely different cluster, so
virtual host selection primarily acts as a way of organising shovels and access to them,
much like with the rest of [permission in RabbitMQ](./access-control).

Every shovel is also named. The name is used to identify shovels when [inspecting their status](#status),
[deleting them](#deleting) or [restarting them](#restarting).


## Declaring a Dynamic Shovel {#declaring}

In this example we will set up a dynamic shovel that will move messages from the queue `"source-queue"` in the
local RabbitMQ cluster to the queue `"target-queue"` on a remote RabbitMQ node, using AMQP 0-9-1.

### Using CLI Tools

A shovel is declared using the `rabbitmqctl set_parameter` command with component name `shovel`, a shovel
name and a definition body which is a JSON document:

```bash
# my-shovel here is the name of the shovel
rabbitmqctl set_parameter shovel my-shovel \
  '{"src-protocol": "amqp091", "src-uri": "amqp://", "src-queue": "source-queue", "dest-protocol": "amqp091", "dest-uri": "amqp://remote-server", "dest-queue": "target-queue", "dest-queue-args": {"x-queue-type": "quorum"}}'
```

On Windows `rabbitmqctl` is named `rabbitmqctl.bat` and command line value escaping will be
different:

```PowerShell
rabbitmqctl.bat set_parameter shovel my-shovel ^
  "{""src-protocol"": ""amqp091"", ""src-uri"":""amqp://localhost"", ""src-queue"": ""source-queue"", ^
   ""dest-protocol"": ""amqp091"", ""dest-uri"": ""amqp://remote.rabbitmq.local"", ^
   ""dest-queue"": ""target-queue"", ""dest-queue-args"": {""x-queue-type"": ""quorum""}}"
```

The body in this example includes a few keys:

  </tbody>
</table>

There are other Shovel definition keys that will be covered later in this guide.

### Pre-declared Topology {#predeclared-topology}

Shovels can use a pre-declared topology instead of declaring its source and destination.

For example, this may be necessary when the topology is [imported from a definitions file at boot time](./definitions#import-on-boot).
Using a pre-declared topology avoids a chicken-and-egg problem between the import of definitions and
Shovel plugin startup: the plugin must be enabled for definitions to pass validation (of the runtime parameters part).

Here is how the plugin can be configured to wait until the source is available [using `rabbitmq.conf`](./configure):

```ini
# all shovels started on this node will use pre-declared topology
shovel.topology.predeclared = true
```

If only some shovels need to use a pre-declared topology, the same behavior can be configured
for specific shovels using the following shovel properties:

<table class="name-description">
  <caption>Additional Dynamic Shovel Definition Settings</caption>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Key</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>src-predeclared</td>
      <td>
        When set to <code>true</code>, the plugin waits until <code>src-queue</code> is available
        instead of declaring the topology itself using <code>src-queue-args</code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>dest-predeclared</td>
      <td>
        When set to <code>true</code>, the plugin waits until <code>dest-queue</code> is available
        instead of declaring the topology itself using <code>dest-queue-args</code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Using HTTP API

To declare a shovel using the HTTP API, make sure that the [management](./management) plugin
is enabled, then use the following endpoint:

```ini
PUT /api/parameters/shovel/{vhost}/{name}
```

where `{vhost}` is the virtual host in which the Shovel should be started and `{name}`
is the name of the new shovel. The endpoint requires that the user that invokes it
has `policymaker` privileges (tag).

The request body is a JSON document similar in structure to that described earlier in this guide:

```ini
{
  "value": {
    "src-protocol": "amqp091",
    "src-uri":  "amqp://localhost",
    "src-queue":  "source-queue",
    "dest-protocol": "amqp091",
    "dest-uri": "amqp://remote.rabbitmq.local",
    "dest-queue": "destination-queue"
  }
}
```

Below is an example that uses `curl` to declare a shovel on a local node using
[default user credentials](./access-control#default-state). The shovel will
transfer messages between two queues, `"source-queue"` and `"destination-queue"`, in the default virtual host.

Note that this exact command would fail if invoked against
a remote node. Please [add a new user](./access-control) tagged as `policymaker`
for your own experiments.

```bash
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
curl -v -u guest:guest -X PUT http://localhost:15672/api/parameters/shovel/%2f/my-shovel \
                       -H "content-type: application/json" \
                       -d @- <<EOF
{
  "value": {
    "src-protocol": "amqp091",
    "src-uri": "amqp://localhost",
    "src-queue": "source-queue",
    "dest-protocol": "amqp091",
    "dest-uri": "amqp://localhost",
    "dest-queue": "destination-queue"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Using Management UI

To declare a shovel using the management UI, first make sure that the [management](./management) plugin
is enabled.

Then

 * Navigate to `Admin` > `Shovel Management` > `Add a new shovel`
 * Fill out the form with shovel parameters covered earlier in this guide
 * Click Add shovel


## Inspecting Status of Dynamic Shovels {#status}

### Using CLI Tools

Use `rabbitmqctl shovel_status` to inspect dynamic shovels in a cluster. The `rabbitmq_shovel`
plugin must be enabled on the host where this command is executed.

```bash
rabbitmqctl shovel_status --formatter=pretty_table
```

The output can be formatted as JSON and redirected to a tool such as [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

```bash
rabbitmqctl shovel_status --formatter=json | jq
```

### Using HTTP API

`GET /api/shovels` is an endpoint that can be used to list dynamic
shovels in a cluster. The endpoint is provided by the `rabbitmq_shovel_management` plugin
which must be enabled on the target node.

```ini
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
 curl -v -u guest:guest -X GET http://localhost:15672/api/shovels/
```

To inspect shovels in a specific virtual host, use `GET /api/shovels/{vhost}`
`{vhost}` is the virtual host name. The value must be percent-encoded.

```ini
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
 curl -v -u guest:guest -X GET http://localhost:15672/api/shovels/%2f
```

To inspect status of a specific shovels, use `GET /api/shovels/vhost/{vhost}/{name}`
`{vhost}` is the virtual host in which the Shovel is running and `{name}`
is the name of the shovel.  Both values must be percent-encoded.

```ini
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
 curl -v -u guest:guest -X GET http://localhost:15672/api/shovels/vhost/%2f/my-shovel
```

### Using Management UI

 * Navigate to `Admin` > `Shovel Status`
 * Locate the shovel of interest in the table


## Restarting a Shovel {#restarting}

A dynamic Shovel can be restarted. Restarting a shovel briefly interrupts its operations
and makes it reconnect to both source and destination. When an appropriate [acknowledgement mode](./confirms) is
used by a shovel, the interruption is safe: any unacknowledged or unconfirmed ("in flight") messages
consumed from the source or published to the destination will be automatically requeued
when the shovel is stopped, and consumed again after the restart.
### Using CLI Tools

Use `rabbitmqctl restart_shovel` to restart a shovel using its name. The `rabbitmq_shovel`
plugin must be enabled on the host where this command is executed.

```bash
rabbitmqctl restart_shovel "my-shovel"
```

### Using HTTP API

`DELETE /api/shovels/vhost/{vhost}/{name}/restart` is an endpoint that restarts
a dynamic shovel. The endpoint is provided by the `rabbitmq_shovel_management` plugin
which must be enabled on the target node.

`{vhost}` is the virtual host in which the Shovel is running and `{name}`
is the name of the shovel to be restarted.  Both values must be percent-encoded.

```ini
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
 curl -v -u guest:guest -X DELETE http://localhost:15672/api/shovels/vhost/%2f/my-shovel/restart
```

### Using Management UI

 * Navigate to `Admin` > `Shovel Status`
 * Locate the shovel of interest in the table
 * Click Restart and wait for the next UI refresh

## Deleting a Shovel {#deleting}

### Using CLI Tools

To delete a Shovel using CLI tools, use `rabbitmqctl clear_parameter` and pass `shovel` for
component name and the name of the shovel that should be deleted:

```bash
rabbitmqctl clear_parameter shovel "my-shovel"
```

### Using HTTP API

`DELETE /api/parameters/shovel/{vhost}/{name}` is the endpoint that can be used
to delete a shovel.

`{vhost}` is the virtual host in which the Shovel is running and `{name}`
is the name of the shovel to be deleted. Both values must be percent-encoded.

```bash
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
curl -v -u guest:guest -X DELETE http://localhost:15672/api/parameters/shovel/%2f/my-shovel
```

## AMQP 1.0 Shovel Definition Reference {#amqp10-reference}

          If set to <code>on-confirm</code> (the default), messages are
          <a href="./confirms">acknowledged</a> to the source broker after they have been confirmed
          by the destination. This handles network errors and broker
          failures without losing messages, and is the slowest option.

        <p>
          If set to <code>on-publish</code>, messages are <a href="./confirms">acknowledged</a> to
          the source broker after they have been published at the
          destination (but not yet confirmed). Messages may be lost in the event of network or broker failures.

          If set to <code>no-ack</code>, <a href="./confirms">automatic message acknowledgements</a> will be used.

          Determines when (if ever) the shovel should delete
          itself. This can be useful if the shovel is being treated
          as more of a move operation - i.e. being used to move
          messages from one queue to another on an ad hoc basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The default is <code>never</code>, meaning the
          shovel should never delete itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          If set to <code>queue-length</code> then the shovel will
          measure the length of the source queue when starting up,
          and delete itself after it has transferred that many
          messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          If set to an integer, then the shovel will transfer that
          number of messages before deleting itself.

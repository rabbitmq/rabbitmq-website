# Configuration

## Overview {#overview}

RabbitMQ comes with default built-in settings. Those can be entirely
sufficient in some environment (e.g. development and QA).
For all other cases, as well as [production deployment tuning](./production-checklist),
there is a way to configure many things in the broker as well as [plugins](./plugins).

This guide covers a number of topics related to configuration:

 * [Different ways](#means-of-configuration) in which various settings of the server and plugins are configured
 * [Configuration file(s)](#configuration-files): primary [rabbitmq.conf](#config-file) or [a directory of .conf files](#config-confd-directory), and optional [advanced.config](#advanced-config-file)
 * Default [configuration file location(s)](#config-location) on various platforms
 * Configuration troubleshooting: how to [find config file location](#verify-configuration-config-file-location) and [inspect and verify effective configuration](#verify-configuration-effective-configuration)
 * [Environment variable interpolation](#env-variable-interpolation) in `rabbitmq.conf`
 * [Environment variables](#customise-environment) used by RabbitMQ nodes
 * [Operating system (kernel) limits](#kernel-limits)
 * Available [core server settings](#config-items)
 * Available [environment variables](#supported-environment-variables)
 * How to [encrypt sensitive configuration values](#configuration-encryption)

and more.

Since configuration affects many areas of the system, including plugins, individual [documentation guides](./index.md)
dive deeper into what can be configured. [Runtime Tuning](./runtime) is a companion to this guide that focuses
on the configurable parameters in the runtime. [Deployment Guidelines](./production-checklist) is a related guide
that outlines what settings will likely need tuning in most production environments.


## Means of Configuration {#means-of-configuration}

A RabbitMQ node can be configured using a number of mechanisms responsible
for different areas:

Most settings are configured using the first two methods. This guide,
therefore, focuses on them.

## Configuration File(s) {#configuration-files}

### Introduction {#config-file-intro}

While some settings in RabbitMQ can be tuned using environment variables,
most are configured using a [main configuration file](#config-file) named `rabbitmq.conf`.

This includes configuration for the core server as well as plugins. An additional configuration
file can be used to configure settings that cannot be expressed in the main file's configuration
format. This is covered in more details below.

The sections below cover the syntax and [location](#config-file-location) of both files,
where to find examples, and more.

### Config File Locations {#config-file-location}

[Default config file locations](./configure#config-location)
vary between operating systems and [package types](./download).

This topic is covered in more detail in the rest of this guide.

When in doubt about RabbitMQ config file location,
consult the log file and/or management UI as explained in the following section.

### How to Find Config File Location {#verify-configuration-config-file-location}

The active configuration file can be verified by inspecting the
RabbitMQ log file. It will show up in the [log file](./logging)
at the top, along with the other broker boot log entries. For example:

```ini
node           : rabbit@example
home dir       : /var/lib/rabbitmq
config file(s) : /etc/rabbitmq/advanced.config
               : /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf
```

If the configuration file cannot be found or read by RabbitMQ, the log entry
will say so:

```ini
node           : rabbit@example
home dir       : /var/lib/rabbitmq
config file(s) : /var/lib/rabbitmq/hare.conf (not found)
```

Alternatively, the location of configuration files used by a local node, use the [rabbitmq-diagnostics status](./man/rabbitmq-diagnostics.8) command:

```bash
# displays key
rabbitmq-diagnostics status
```

and look for the `Config files` section that would look like this:

```
Config files

 * /etc/rabbitmq/advanced.config
 * /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf
```

To inspect the locations of a specific node, including nodes running remotely, use the `-n` (short for `--node`) switch:

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics status -n [node name]
```

Finally, config file location can be found in the [management UI](./management),
together with other details about nodes.

When troubleshooting configuration settings, it is very useful to verify that the config file
path is correct, exists and can be loaded (e.g. the file is readable) before [verifying effective node configuration](#verify-configuration-effective-configuration).
Together, these steps help quickly narrow down most common misconfiguration problems.

### The Modern and Old Config File Formats {#config-file-formats}

All [supported RabbitMQ versions](/release-information) use an [ini-like, sysctl configuration file format](#config-file)
for the main configuration file. The file is typically named `rabbitmq.conf`.

The new config format is much simpler, easier for humans to read
and machines to generate. It is also relatively limited compared
to the classic config format used prior to RabbitMQ 3.7.0.
For example, when configuring [LDAP support](./ldap), it may be necessary to use deeply nested data structures to
express desired configuration.

To accommodate this need, modern RabbitMQ versions allow for both formats to be used at the same time
in separate files: `rabbitmq.conf` uses the new style format and is recommended for most settings,
and `advanced.config` covers more advanced settings that the ini-style configuration
cannot express. This is covered in more detail in the following sections.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Configuration File</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Format Used</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Purpose</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`rabbitmq.conf`</td>
      <td>New style format (sysctl or ini-like)</td>
      <td>
        [Primary configuration file](#config-file) with a `.conf` extension. Should be used for most settings.
        It is easier for humans to read and machines (deployment tools) to generate.
        Not every setting can be expressed in this format.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`advanced.config`</td>
      <td>Classic (Erlang terms)</td>
      <td>
        A limited number of settings that cannot be expressed
        in the new style configuration format, such as [LDAP queries](./ldap).
        Only should be used when necessary.

                           {keyfile,              "/path/to/server_key.pem"},
                           {verify,               verify_peer},
                           {fail_if_no_peer_cert, true}]}]}
].
```

### The Main Configuration File, rabbitmq.conf {#config-file}

The configuration file `rabbitmq.conf`
allows the RabbitMQ server and plugins to be configured.
The file uses the [sysctl format](https://github.com/basho/cuttlefish/wiki/Cuttlefish-for-Application-Users),
unlike `advanced.config` and the original `rabbitmq.config` (both use the Erlang terms format).

The syntax can be briefly explained in 3 lines:

 * One setting uses one line
 * Lines are structured `Key = Value`
 * Any line starting with a `#` character is a comment
 * Values that contain the `#` character, such as generated strings, generated passwords, encrypted values,
   and so on, can be escaped with single quotes like so: `'efd3!53a9@92#a08_d_6d'`

A minimalistic example configuration file follows:

```ini
# this is a comment
listeners.tcp.default = 5673
```

The above example is equivalent to the following [classic config format](#config-file-formats):

```erlang
%% this is a comment
[
  {rabbit, [
      {tcp_listeners, [5673]}
    ]
  }
].
```

This example will alter the [port RabbitMQ listens on](./networking#ports) for
AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0 client connections from 5672 to 5673.

The RabbitMQ server source repository contains [an example rabbitmq.conf file](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbit/docs/rabbitmq.conf.example)
named `rabbitmq.conf.example`. It contains examples of
most of the configuration items you might want to set (with some very obscure ones omitted), along with
documentation for those settings.

Documentation guides such as [Networking](./networking), [TLS](./ssl), or
[Access Control](./access-control) contain many examples in relevant formats.

Note that this configuration file is not to be confused with the environment variable
configuration files, [rabbitmq-env.conf](#environment-env-file-unix)
and [rabbitmq-env-conf.bat](#rabbitmq-env-file-windows).

To override the main RabbitMQ config file location, use the `RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILE`
(or `RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILES` to use a `conf.d`-style directory of sorted files) [environment variables](#customise-environment).
Use `.conf` as file extension for the new style config format, e.g. `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf` or
`/data/configuration/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`

### Value Escaping

:::important
Lines that use escaped values must not contain any (in particularly trailing) comments. Please any comments necessary
above the line instead.
:::

Values that contain the `#` character, usually machine-generated, can be escaped with single quotes:

``` ini
# escaping is not necessary here but may be a good idea for generated
# values
default_user = '7f11ddc4f1900a233964'
# escaping is important here as without it,
# the # character and everything that follows it would be
# considered a comment
default_pass = 'efd3!53a9@92#a08_d_6d'
```

### Using a Directory of .conf Files {#config-confd-directory}

A `conf.d`-style directory of files can also be used. Use `RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILES` (note the plural "_FILES")
to point the node at a directory of such files:

```ini
# uses a directory of .conf files loaded in alphabetical order
RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILES=/path/to/a/custom/location/rabbitmq/conf.d
```

Target directory must contain a number of `.conf` files with the same syntax as `rabbitmq.conf`.

They will be **loaded in alphabetical order**. A common naming practice uses numerical prefixes
in filenames to make it easier to reason about the order, or make sure a "defaults file"
is always loaded first, regardless of how many extra files are generated at deployment time:

```bash
ls -lh /path/to/a/custom/location/rabbitmq/conf.d
# => -r--r--r--  1 rabbitmq  rabbitmq    87B Mar 21 19:50 00-defaults.conf
# => -r--r--r--  1 rabbitmq  rabbitmq   4.6K Mar 21 19:52 10-main.conf
# => -r--r--r--  1 rabbitmq  rabbitmq   1.6K Mar 21 19:52 20-tls.conf
# => -r--r--r--  1 rabbitmq  rabbitmq   1.6K Mar 21 19:52 30-federation.conf
```

### Environment Variable Interpolation in `rabbitmq.conf` {#env-variable-interpolation}

[Modern RabbitMQ versions](/release-information) support environment variable interpolation in `rabbitmq.conf`. For example,
to override default user credentials, one can use [import a definition file](./definitions)
or the following config file in combination with two environment variables:

```ini
# environment variable interpolation
default_user = $(SEED_USERNAME)
default_pass = $(SEED_USER_PASSWORD)
```

Environment variables can be used to configure a portion of a value, for example,
cluster name:

```ini
cluster_name = deployment-$(DEPLOYMENT_ID)
```

Environment variable values are interpolated as strings before the config file is parsed and validated.
This means that they can be used to override numerical settings (such as ports) or paths (such as TLS certificate and private key paths).

In addition, RabbitMQ respects a [number of environment variables](#customise-environment) for when a value must be known before
the configuration file is loaded.


### The advanced.config File {#advanced-config-file}

:::info
This section describes the original configuration format that has been superseded by
a [modern alternative](#config-file).

Only a limited number of features and advanced (or rarely used) settings require the use
of this format. When this is an option, use `rabbitmq.conf`.
:::

Some configuration settings are not possible or are difficult to configure
using the sysctl format. As such, it is possible to use an additional
config file in the Erlang term format (same as `rabbitmq.config`).
That file is commonly named `advanced.config`. It will be merged
with the configuration provided in `rabbitmq.conf`.

The RabbitMQ server source repository contains [an example advanced.config file](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/v3.13.x/deps/rabbit/docs/advanced.config.example)
named `advanced.config.example`. It focuses on the options that are typically set using the advanced config.

To override the advanced config file location, use the `RABBITMQ_ADVANCED_CONFIG_FILE`
environment variable.

### Location of rabbitmq.conf, advanced.config and rabbitmq-env.conf {#config-location}

Default configuration file location is distribution-specific. RabbitMQ packages or nodes will not create
any configuration files. Users and deployment tool should use the following locations when creating the files:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Platform</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Default Configuration File Directory</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Example Configuration File Paths</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [Generic binary package](./install-generic-unix)
      </td>
      <td>
        `$RABBITMQ_HOME/etc/rabbitmq/`
      </td>
      <td>
        `$RABBITMQ_HOME/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`,
        `$RABBITMQ_HOME/etc/rabbitmq/advanced.config`
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [Debian and Ubuntu](./install-debian)
      </td>
      <td>
        `/etc/rabbitmq/`
      </td>
      <td>
        `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`,
        `/etc/rabbitmq/advanced.config`
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [RPM-based Linux](./install-rpm)
      </td>
      <td>
        `/etc/rabbitmq/`
      </td>
      <td>
        `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`,
        `/etc/rabbitmq/advanced.config`
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [Windows](./install-windows)
      </td>
      <td>
        `%APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\`
      </td>
      <td>
        `%APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\rabbitmq.conf`,
        `%APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\advanced.config`
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [MacOS Homebrew Formula](./install-homebrew)
      </td>
      <td>
        `${install_prefix}/etc/rabbitmq/`,
        and the Homebrew cellar prefix is usually `/usr/local`
      </td>
      <td>
        `${install_prefix}/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`,
        `${install_prefix}/etc/rabbitmq/advanced.config`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Environment variables can be used to override the location of the configuration file:

```ini
# overrides primary config file location
RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/a/custom/location/rabbitmq.conf

# overrides advanced config file location
RABBITMQ_ADVANCED_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/a/custom/location/advanced.config

# overrides environment variable file location
RABBITMQ_CONF_ENV_FILE=/path/to/a/custom/location/rabbitmq-env.conf
```

### When Will Configuration File Changes Be Applied {#config-changes-effects}

`rabbitmq.conf` and `advanced.config` changes take effect after a node restart.

If `rabbitmq-env.conf` doesn't exist, it can be created manually
in the location specified by the `RABBITMQ_CONF_ENV_FILE` variable.
On Windows systems, it is named `rabbitmq-env-conf.bat`.

Windows service users will need to **[re-install the service](#rabbitmq-env-file-windows)** if
configuration file location or any values in ``rabbitmq-env-conf.bat` have changed.
Environment variables used by the service would not be updated otherwise.

In the context of deployment automation this means that environment variables
such as `RABBITMQ_BASE` and `RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILE` should ideally be set before RabbitMQ is installed.
This would help avoid unnecessary confusion and Windows service re-installations.

### How to Inspect and Verify Effective Configuration of a Running Node {#verify-configuration-effective-configuration}

It is possible to print effective configuration (user provided values from all configuration files merged into defaults) using
the [rabbitmq-diagnostics environment](./man/rabbitmq-diagnostics.8) command:

```bash
# inspect effective configuration on a node
rabbitmq-diagnostics environment
```

to check effective configuration of a specific node, including nodes running remotely, use the `-n` (short for `--node`) switch:

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics environment -n [node name]
```

The command above will print applied configuration for every application (RabbitMQ, plugins, libraries) running on the node.
Effective configuration is computed using the following steps:

 * `rabbitmq.conf` is translated into the internally used (advanced) config format. These configuration is merged into the defaults
 * `advanced.config` is loaded if present, and merged into the result of the step above

Effective configuration should be verified together with [config file location](#verify-configuration-config-file-location).
Together, these steps help quickly narrow down most common misconfiguration problems.

### The rabbitmq.config (Classic Format) File {#erlang-term-config-file}

Prior to RabbitMQ 3.7.0, RabbitMQ config file was named
`rabbitmq.config` and used [the same Erlang term format](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/config.html) used by `advanced.config` today.
That format is [still supported](#config-file-formats) for backwards compatibility.

The classic format is **deprecated**. Please prefer the [new style config format](#config-file)
in `rabbitmq.conf` accompanied by an `advanced.config` file as needed.

To use a config file in the classic format, export `RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILE` to point to the file with
a `.config` extension. The extension will indicate to RabbitMQ that it should treat the file as one
in the classic config format.

[An example configuration file](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/v3.7.x/deps/rabbit/docs/rabbitmq.config.example) named
`rabbitmq.config.example`. It contains an example of most of the configuration items in the classic config format.

To override the main RabbitMQ config file location, use the `RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILE`
[environment variable](#customise-environment). Use `.config` as file extension
for the classic config format.

The use of classic config format should only be limited to the [advanced.config file](#advanced-config-file) and settings
that cannot be configured using the [ini-style config file](#config-file).

### Example Configuration Files {#example-config}

The RabbitMQ server source repository contains
examples for the configuration files:

 * [rabbitmq.conf.example](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbit/docs/rabbitmq.conf.example)
 * [advanced.config.example](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbit/docs/advanced.config.example)

These files contain examples of most of the configuration keys along with a brief explanation
for those settings. All configuration items are commented out in the
example, so you can uncomment what you need. Note that the
example files are meant to be used as, well, examples, and
should not be treated as a general recommendation.

In most distributions the example file is placed into the
same location as the real file should be placed (see
above). On Debian and RPM distributions
policy forbids doing so; instead find the file
under `/usr/share/doc/rabbitmq-server/`
or <code>{`/usr/share/doc/rabbitmq-server-${RabbitMQServerVersion()}/`}</code>,
respectively.

### Core Server Variables Configurable in rabbitmq.conf {#config-items}

These variables are the most common. The list is not complete, as
some settings are quite obscure.

Several [plugins](./plugins) that ship with RabbitMQ have
dedicated documentation guides that cover plugin configuration:

 * [rabbitmq_management](./management#configuration)
 * [rabbitmq_management_agent](./management#configuration)
 * [rabbitmq_stomp](./stomp)
 * [rabbitmq_mqtt](./mqtt)
 * [rabbitmq_shovel](./shovel)

## Configuration Value Encryption {#configuration-encryption}

Sensitive `advanced.config` entries (e.g. password, URL containing
credentials) can be encrypted. RabbitMQ nodes then decrypt encrypted entries on boot.

Note that encrypted configuration entries don't make the
system meaningfully more secure. Nevertheless, they
allow deployments of RabbitMQ to conform to
regulations in various countries requiring
that no sensitive data should appear in plain text
in configuration files.

Encrypted values must be inside an Erlang `encrypted`
tuple: `{encrypted, ...}`.
Here is an example of a configuration file with an encrypted password
for the default user:

```erlang
[
  {rabbit, [
      {default_user, <<"guest">>},
      {default_pass,
        {encrypted,
         <<"cPAymwqmMnbPXXRVqVzpxJdrS8mHEKuo2V+3vt1u/fymexD9oztQ2G/oJ4PAaSb2c5N/hRJ2aqP/X0VAfx8xOQ==">>
        }
      },
      {config_entry_decoder, [
             {passphrase, <<"mypassphrase">>}
         ]}
    ]}
].
```

Note the `config_entry_decoder` key with the passphrase
that RabbitMQ will use to decrypt encrypted values.

The passphrase doesn't have to be hardcoded in the configuration file,
it can be in a separate file:

```erlang
[
  {rabbit, [
      %% ...
      {config_entry_decoder, [
             {passphrase, {file, "/path/to/passphrase/file"}}
         ]}
    ]}
].
```

RabbitMQ can also request an operator to enter the passphrase
when it starts by using `{passphrase, prompt}`.

### Encrypting advanced.config Values Using CLI Tools {#configuration-encryption-encode-value}

Use [rabbitmqctl](./cli) and the `encode`
command to encrypt values:

```bash
# <<"guest">> here is a value to encode, as an Erlang binary,
# as it would have appeared in advanced.config
rabbitmqctl encode '<<"guest">>' mypassphrase
{encrypted,<<"... long encrypted value...">>}
# "amqp://fred:secret@host1.domain/my_vhost" here is a value to encode, provided as an Erlang string,
# as it would have appeared in advanced.config
rabbitmqctl encode '"amqp://fred:secret@host1.domain/my_vhost"' mypassphrase
{encrypted,<<"... long encrypted value...">>}
```

Or, on Windows:

```PowerShell
# <<"guest">> here is a value to encode, as an Erlang binary,
# as it would have appeared in advanced.config
rabbitmqctl encode "<<""guest"">>" mypassphrase
{encrypted,<<"... long encrypted value...">>}
# "amqp://fred:secret@host1.domain/my_vhost" here is a value to encode, provided as an Erlang string,
# as it would have appeared in advanced.config
rabbitmqctl encode '"amqp://fred:secret@host1.domain/my_vhost"' mypassphrase
{encrypted,<<"... long encrypted value...">>}
```

### Decrypting advanced.config Values Using CLI Tools {#configuration-encryption-decode-value}

Use the `decode` command to decrypt values:

```bash
rabbitmqctl decode '{encrypted, <<"...">>}' mypassphrase
# => <<"guest">>
rabbitmqctl decode '{encrypted, <<"...">>}' mypassphrase
# => "amqp://fred:secret@host1.domain/my_vhost"
```

Or, on Windows:

```PowerShell
rabbitmqctl decode "{encrypted, <<""..."">>}" mypassphrase
# => <<"guest">>
rabbitmqctl decode "{encrypted, <<""..."">>}" mypassphrase
# => "amqp://fred:secret@host1.domain/my_vhost"
```

Values of different types can be encoded. The example above encodes
both binaries (`<<"guest">>`) and strings
(`"amqp://fred:secret@host1.domain/my_vhost"`).

### Encryption Settings: Cipher, Hashing Function, Number of Iterations {#configuration-encryption-settings}

The encryption mechanism uses PBKDF2 to produce a derived key
from the passphrase. The default hash function is SHA512
and the default number of iterations is 1000. The default
cipher is AES 256 CBC.

These defaults can be changed in the configuration file:

```erlang
[
  {rabbit, [
      ...
      {config_entry_decoder, [
             {passphrase, "mypassphrase"},
             {cipher, blowfish_cfb64},
             {hash, sha256},
             {iterations, 10000}
         ]}
    ]}
].
```

Or, using [CLI tools](./cli):

```bash
rabbitmqctl encode --cipher blowfish_cfb64 --hash sha256 --iterations 10000 \
                     '<<"guest">>' mypassphrase
```

Or, on Windows:

```PowerShell
rabbitmqctl encode --cipher blowfish_cfb64 --hash sha256 --iterations 10000 \
                     "<<""guest"">>" mypassphrase
```


## Configuration Using Environment Variables {#customise-environment}

Certain server parameters can be configured using environment variables:
[node name](./cli#node-names), RabbitMQ [configuration file location](#configuration-files),
[inter-node communication ports](./networking#ports), Erlang VM flags, and so on.

### Path and Directory Name Restrictions {#directory-and-path-restrictions}

Some of the environment variable configure paths and locations (node's base or data directory, [plugin source and expansion directories](./plugins),
and so on). Those paths have must exclude a number of characters:

 * `*` and `?` (on Linux, macOS, BSD and other UNIX-like systems)
 * `^` and `!` (on Windows)
 * `[` and `]`
 * `{` and `}`

The above characters will render the node unable to start or function as expected (e.g. expand plugins and load their metadata).

### Linux, MacOS, BSD {#environment-env-file-unix}

On UNIX-based systems (Linux, MacOS and flavours of BSD) it is possible to
use a file named ``rabbitmq-env.conf``
to define environment variables that will be used by the broker.
Its [location](#config-location) is configurable
using the `RABBITMQ_CONF_ENV_FILE` environment variable.

``rabbitmq-env.conf`` uses the standard environment variable names
but without the `RABBITMQ_` prefix. For example, the
`RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILE` variable appears below as `CONFIG_FILE` and
`RABBITMQ_NODENAME` becomes `NODENAME`:

```bash
# Example rabbitmq-env.conf file entries. Note that the variables
# do not have the RABBITMQ_ prefix.
#
# Overrides node name
NODENAME=bunny@myhost

# Specifies new style config file location
CONFIG_FILE=/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf

# Specifies advanced config file location
ADVANCED_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/rabbitmq/advanced.config
```

See the [rabbitmq-env.conf man page](./man/rabbitmq-env.conf.5) for details.

### Windows {#rabbitmq-env-file-windows}

The easiest option to customise names, ports or locations is
to configure environment variables in the Windows dialogue:
Start&#xA0;>&#xA0;Settings&#xA0;>&#xA0;Control&#xA0;Panel&#xA0;>&#xA0;System&#xA0;>&#xA0;Advanced&#xA0;>&#xA0;Environment&#xA0;Variables.
Then create or edit the system variable name and value.

Alternatively it is possible to use a file named `rabbitmq-env-conf.bat`
to define environment variables that will be used by the broker.
Its [location](#config-location) is configurable
using the `RABBITMQ_CONF_ENV_FILE` environment variable.

Windows service users will need to **re-install the service** if configuration file location
or any values in ``rabbitmq-env-conf.bat` changed. Environment variables used by
the service would not be updated otherwise.

This can be done using the installer or on the command line
with administrator permissions:

 * Start an [administrative command prompt](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc947813%28v=ws.10%29.aspx)
 * cd into the sbin folder under the RabbitMQ server installation directory (such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-{version}\sbin`)
 * Run `rabbitmq-service.bat stop` to stop the service
 * Run `rabbitmq-service.bat remove` to remove the Windows service (this will *not* remove RabbitMQ or its data directory)
 * Set environment variables via command line, i.e. run commands like the following:
   ```PowerShell
   set RABBITMQ_BASE=C:\Data\RabbitMQ
   ```
 * Run `rabbitmq-service.bat install`
 * Run `rabbitmq-service.bat start`

This will restart the node in a way that makes the environment variable and
`rabbitmq-env-conf.bat` changes to be observable to it.


## Environment Variables Used by RabbitMQ {#supported-environment-variables}

All environment variables used by RabbitMQ use the
prefix `RABBITMQ_` (except when defined in [rabbitmq-env.conf](#environment-env-file-unix) or
[rabbitmq-env-conf.bat](#rabbitmq-env-file-windows)).

Environment variables set in the shell environment take
priority over those set
in [rabbitmq-env.conf](#environment-env-file-unix) or
[rabbitmq-env-conf.bat](#rabbitmq-env-file-windows), which in turn override
RabbitMQ built-in defaults.

The table below describes key environment variables that can be used to configure RabbitMQ.
More variables are covered in the [File and Directory Locations guide](./relocate).

Besides the variables listed above, there are several environment variables which
tell RabbitMQ [where to locate its database, log files, plugins, configuration and so on](./relocate).

Finally, some environment variables are operating system-specific.

## Operating System Kernel Limits {#kernel-limits}

Most operating systems enforce limits on kernel resources: virtual memory, stack size, open file handles
and more. To Linux users these limits can be known as "ulimit limits".

RabbitMQ nodes are most commonly affected by the maximum [open file handle limit](./networking#open-file-handle-limit).
Default limit value on most Linux distributions is usually 1024, which is very low for a messaging broker (or generally, any data service).
See [Deployment Guidelines](./production-checklist) for recommended values.

### Modifying Limits

#### With systemd (Modern Linux Distributions)

On distributions that use systemd, the OS limits are controlled via
a configuration file at `/etc/systemd/system/rabbitmq-server.service.d/limits.conf`.
For example, to set the max open file handle limit (`nofile`) to `64000`:

```
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=64000
```

See [systemd documentation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html) to learn about
the supported limits and other directives.

#### With Docker

To configure kernel limits for Docker containers, use the `"default-ulimits"` key in
[Docker daemon configuration file](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file).
The file has to be installed on Docker hosts at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "default-ulimits": {
    "nofile": {
      "Name": "nofile",
      "Hard": 64000,
      "Soft": 64000
    }
  }
}
```

#### Without systemd (Older Linux Distributions)

The most straightforward way to adjust the per-user limit for
RabbitMQ on distributions that do not use systemd is to edit the `/etc/default/rabbitmq-server`
(provided by the RabbitMQ Debian package) or [rabbitmq-env.conf](#config-file)
to invoke `ulimit` before the service is started.

```
ulimit -S -n 4096
```

This _soft_ limit cannot go higher than the _hard_ limit (which defaults to 4096 in many distributions).
[The hard limit can be increased](https://github.com/basho/basho_docs/blob/master/content/riak/kv/2.2.3/using/performance/open-files-limit.md) via
`/etc/security/limits.conf`. This also requires enabling the [pam_limits.so](http://askubuntu.com/a/34559) module
and re-login or reboot.

Note that limits cannot be changed for running OS processes.

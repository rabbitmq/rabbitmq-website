# Which protocols does RabbitMQ support?

RabbitMQ supports several messaging protocols, directly and through the
use of plugins. This page describes the supported protocols and
helps differentiate between them.

## AMQP 0-9-1 {#amqp-091}

RabbitMQ was originally developed to [support AMQP 0-9-1](/amqp-0-9-1-protocol).
As such this protocol has been the first "core" protocol supported by
the broker. We have [extended](./extensions) AMQP 0-9-1 in various ways.

AMQP 0-9-1 is a binary protocol, and defines quite strong
messaging semantics. For clients it's a reasonably easy
protocol to implement, and as such there
are [a large number of client libraries](/client-libraries/devtools) available for
many different programming languages and environments.

[RabbitMQ tutorials](/tutorials) are available for AMQP 0-9-1.


## AMQP 1.0 {#amqp-10}

[AMQP 1.0](./amqp) is a more modern protocol.
It is an [ISO/IEC 19464](https://www.iso.org/standard/64955.html) and [OASIS](https://www.amqp.org/node/102) standard.

Despite the name, AMQP 1.0 is a very different protocol from AMQP 0-9-1 / 0-9 / 0-8, sharing nothing at the wire level.
AMQP 1.0 imposes fewer semantic requirements and is therefore supported by more message brokers.
The protocol is more complex than AMQP 0-9-1, and there are fewer client implementations.

[AMQP 1.0 has become a "core" protocol in RabbitMQ 4.0](/blog/2024/08/05/native-amqp).


## RabbitMQ Streams {#rabbitmq-streams}

The [RabbitMQ Streams protocol](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/v3.13.x/deps/rabbitmq_stream/docs/PROTOCOL.adoc) allows communicating with [streams](./streams) at very high throughput.
RabbitMQ supports the streams protocol natively via a [plugin](./stream).

[RabbitMQ tutorials](/tutorials) are available for the RabbitMQ Streams protocol.


## MQTT {#mqtt}

[MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) is a binary protocol
emphasising lightweight publish / subscribe messaging,
targeted towards clients in constrained devices. It has
well defined messaging semantics for publish / subscribe,
but not for other messaging idioms.

RabbitMQ supports MQTT versions 3.1, 3.1.1, and 5.0 [natively](/blog/2023/03/21/native-mqtt) via a [plugin](./mqtt).


## STOMP {#stomp}

[STOMP](http://stomp.github.io/) is a text-based
messaging protocol emphasising (protocol) simplicity. It
defines little in the way of messaging semantics, but is
easy to implement and very easy to implement partially (it's
the only protocol that can be used by hand over telnet).

RabbitMQ supports STOMP (all current versions) via
a [plugin](./stomp) by proxying internally over AMQP 0-9-1.

## WebSocket

Browser applications can use any of the following three application layer protocols to communicate with RabbitMQ over the [WebSocket protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455):
1. [AMQP 1.0 over WebSocket](/blog/2025/04/16/amqp-websocket)
2. [MQTT over WebSocket](./web-mqtt)
3. [STOMP over WebSocket](./web-stomp)

## HTTP

While HTTP is not really a messaging protocol, the [management plugin](./management) supports a simple HTTP API to send and receive messages.
This is primarily intended for diagnostic purposes but can be used for low volume messaging without [reliable delivery](./reliability).

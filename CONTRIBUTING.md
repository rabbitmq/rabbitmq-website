## Overview

RabbitMQ projects use pull requests to discuss, collaborate on and accept code contributions.
Pull requests is the primary place of discussing code changes.

## How to Contribute

The process is fairly standard:

 * Fork the repository
 * Pick what branch you'd like to base your work on. Something that can be deployed
   immediately should be branched off of the `live` branch.
 * Create a branch with a descriptive name
 * Make your changes, run tests, commit with a [descriptive message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), push to your fork
 * Submit pull requests with an explanation what has been changed and **why**
 * Submit a filled out and signed [Contributor Agreement](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ca#how-to-submit) if needed (see below)
 * Be patient. We will get to your pull request eventually

If what you are going to work on is a substantial change, please first ask the core team
of their opinion on [RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users).


## Code of Conduct

See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## Contributor Agreement

If you want to contribute a non-trivial change, please submit a signed copy of our
[Contributor Agreement](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ca#how-to-submit) around the time
you submit your pull request. This will make it much easier (in some cases, possible)
for the RabbitMQ team at Pivotal to merge your contribution.

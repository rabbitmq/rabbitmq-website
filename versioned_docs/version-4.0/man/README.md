# RabbitMQ man Pages

## Source Files

These pages contain source files that reside in the [server repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v4.0.x/docs).
They are converted to HTML using `mandoc`:

### With Make

``` shell
# from rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server
gmake web-manpages
ls -l deps/rabbit/docs/*
```

### With Bazel

``` shell
# from rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server
bazel build //deps/rabbit:web-manpages
tar xf bazel-bin/deps/rabbit/web-manpages.tar
```

## Contributions

Since these files are generated, it is important to keep them in sync with the source.
Accepting community contributions — which will always come as website pull requests —
is fine but the person who merges them is responsible for backporting all changes
to the source pages.


## Adding a New Man Page

When a new man page is added, its contents as generated by `mandoc` have to
be copied into this directory. A new wrapper DocBook page must be added
to the parent (`site`) directory, see `site/rabbitmq-diagnostics.8.xml` for example.

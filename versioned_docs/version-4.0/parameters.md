# Parameters and Policies

## Overview {#overview}

While much of the configuration for RabbitMQ lives in
the [configuration file](./configure), some things
do not mesh well with the use of a configuration file:

 * If they need to be the same across all nodes in a cluster
 * If they are likely to change at run time

RabbitMQ calls these items _parameters_. Parameters can be
set by invoking [`rabbitmqctl`](./man/rabbitmqctl.8)
or through [the HTTP API](./management).

There are two kinds of parameters: vhost-scoped parameters and global parameters.
Vhost-scoped parameters are tied to a virtual host and consist
of a component name, a name and a value.

Global parameters are not tied to a particular virtual host and they consist
of a name and value.

One special case of parameters usage is [policies](#policies).

Policies is **the recommended way** of specifying
[optional arguments](./queues#optional-arguments) for groups of queues and exchanges, as well
as plugins such as [Federation](./federation)
and [Shovel](./shovel).

Policies are vhost-scoped.

[Operator policies](#operator-policies) allow cluster operators override certain arguments
defined in regular policies. This special policy type was designed for defining
guardrails, for example, limiting maximum queue size, enforcing a quorum queue and stream
initial replication factor, and so on.

Operator policies are particularly important in environments where RabbitMQ is offered
as a service, that is, where it is operated by one team but consumed by multiple other
teams or external customers.


## Global and Per-vhost Parameters {#parameter-management}

As stated above, there are vhost-scoped parameters and global parameters.
An example of vhost-scoped
parameter is a federation upstream: it targets a component
(`federation-upstream`), it has a name that identifies
it, it's tied to a virtual host (federation links will target
some resources of this virtual host), and its value defines connection
parameters to an upstream broker.

Virtual host-scoped parameters can be set, cleared and listed:

<Tabs groupId="shell-specific">
<TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>
```bash
# sets a runtime parameter in a virtual host
rabbitmqctl set_parameter [-p vhost] <component_name> <name> <value>

# clears (unsets) a runtime parameter in a virtual host
rabbitmqctl clear_parameter [-p vhost] <component_name> <name>

# lists runtime parameters in a virtual host
rabbitmqctl list_parameters [-p vhost]
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="PowerShell" label="PowerShell">
```PowerShell
# sets a runtime parameter in a virtual host
rabbitmqctl.bat set_parameter [-p vhost] <component_name> <name> <value>

# clears (unsets) a runtime parameter in a virtual host
rabbitmqctl.bat clear_parameter [-p vhost] <component_name> <name>

# lists runtime parameters in a virtual host
rabbitmqctl.bat list_parameters [-p vhost]
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="HTTP API" label="HTTP API">
```ini
PUT /api/parameters/{component_name}/{vhost}/{name}
DELETE /api/parameters/{component_name}/{vhost}/{name}
GET /api/parameters
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Global parameters is the other kind of parameters.
An example of a global parameter is the name of the cluster.
Global parameters can be set, cleared and listed:

<Tabs groupId="shell-specific">
<TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>
```bash
# sets a global (virtual-host-independent) runtime parameter
rabbitmqctl set_global_parameter <name> <value>

# clears (unsets) a global (virtual-host-independent) runtime parameter
rabbitmqctl clear_global_parameter <name>

# lists global (virtual-host-independent) runtime parameters
rabbitmqctl list_global_parameters
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="PowerShell" label="PowerShell">
```PowerShell
# sets a global (virtual-host-independent) runtime parameter
rabbitmqctl.bat set_global_parameter <name> <value>

# clears (unsets) a global (virtual-host-independent) runtime parameter
rabbitmqctl.bat clear_global_parameter <name>

# lists global (virtual-host-independent) runtime parameters
rabbitmqctl.bat list_global_parameters
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="HTTP API" label="HTTP API">
```ini
PUT /api/global-parameters/name
DELETE /api/global-parameters/name
GET /api/global-parameters
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Since a parameter value is a JSON document, you will usually
need to quote it when creating one on the command line
with `rabbitmqctl`. On Unix it is usually easiest to
quote the whole document with single quotes, and use double
quotes within it. On Windows you will have to escape every
double quote. We give examples for both Unix and Windows for
this reason.

Parameters reside in the database used by RabbitMQ for
definitions of virtual hosts, exchanges, queues, bindings, users
and permissions. Parameters are exported along with other object
definitions by the management plugin's export feature.

Vhost-scoped parameters are used by the federation and shovel plugins.
Global parameters are used by the MQTT plugin.

## Policies {#policies}

:::tip
Policies is a mechanism of configuring certain properties of groups
of queues, streams, exchanges. They are designed for parameters that can change at runtime.
:::

:::note
Since queue (stream) type is set at declaration time and cannot be changed, policies cannot
be used to configure queue type, by design. To specify queue (stream) type, use [optional arguments](./queues#optional-arguments).
:::

Policies is **the recommended way** of configuring [optional arguments](./queues#optional-arguments)
for queues, exchanges, and some plugins.

Two notable exceptions are the queue type
and the [maximum number of priorities](./priority) of classic queues. Those values intentionally
cannot be configured by policies: their values are fixed at queue declaration time.

### Why Policies Exist {#why-policies-exist}

Before we explain what policies are and how to use them it would
be helpful to explain why they were introduced to RabbitMQ.

In addition to mandatory properties
(e.g. `durable` or `exclusive`),
queues and exchanges in RabbitMQ have [optional arguments](./queues#optional-arguments),
sometimes referred to as `x-arguments`.

Those are provided by clients when
they declare queues (exchanges) and control various optional
features, such as [queue length limit](./maxlength) or
[TTL](./ttl).

Client-controlled properties in some of the protocols RabbitMQ supports
generally work well but they can be inflexible: updating TTL values
or mirroring parameters that way required application changes, redeployment
and queue re-declaration (which involves deletion). In addition, there is
no way to control the extra arguments for groups of queues and exchanges.
Policies were introduced to address the above pain points.

A policy matches one or more queues by name (using a regular
expression pattern) and appends its definition (a map of
optional arguments) to the x-arguments of the matching
queues. In other words, it is possible to configure
x-arguments for multiple queues at once with a policy, and
update them all at once by updating policy definition.

In modern versions of RabbitMQ the set of features which can
be controlled by policy is not the same as the set of
features which can be controlled by client-provided
arguments.

### How Policies Work {#how-policies-work}

Key policy attributes are

* name: it can be anything but ASCII-based names without spaces are recommended
* pattern: a regular expression that matches one or more queue (exchange) names.
  Any regular expression can be used.
* definition: a set of key/value pairs (think a JSON document) that will be injected
  into the map of optional arguments of the matching queues and exchanges
* [policy priority](#policy-priorities) used to determine which policy should be
  applied to a queue or exchange if multiple policies match its name

Policies automatically match against exchanges and queues,
and help determine how they behave. Each exchange or queue
will have at most one policy matching (see <a href="#combining-policy-definitions">Combining Policy Definitions</a> below),
and each policy then injects a set of key-value pairs (policy definition) on to the matching
queues (exchanges).

Policies can match only queues of a specific type, all queues, only exchanges, or all queues and exchanges.
This is controlled using the `apply-to` flag when a policy is created.

Policies can change at any time. When a policy definition is
updated, its effect on matching exchanges and queues will be
reapplied. Usually it happens instantaneously but for very
busy queues can take a bit of time (say, a few seconds).

Policies are matched and applied every time an exchange or
queue is created, not just when the policy is created.

Policies can be used to configure

 * [federation](./federation)
 * [alternate exchanges](./ae)
 * [dead lettering](./dlx),
 * [per-queue TTLs](./ttl)
 * [queue length limit](./maxlength)

 and other features.

An example of defining a policy looks like:

<Tabs groupId="shell-specific">
<TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>
```bash
rabbitmqctl set_policy federate-me \
    "^federated\." '{"federation-upstream-set":"all"}' \
    --priority 1 \
    --apply-to exchanges
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="PowerShell" label="PowerShell">
```PowerShell
rabbitmqctl.bat set_policy federate-me ^
    "^federated\." "{""federation-upstream-set"":""all""}" ^
    --priority 1 ^
    --apply-to exchanges
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="HTTP API" label="HTTP API">
```ini
PUT /api/policies/%2f/federate-me
    {"pattern": "^federated\.",
     "definition": {"federation-upstream-set":"all"},
     "priority": 1,
    "apply-to": "exchanges"}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Management UI" label="Management UI">
<ol>
  <li>
    Navigate to `Admin` > `Policies` > `Add / update a
    policy`.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter a policy name (such as "federated") next to Name, a pattern (such as "^federated\.") next to
    Pattern, and select what kind of entities (exchanges in this example) the policy should apply to using the `Apply to`
    drop down.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter "federation-upstream-set" = "all" (or a specific upstream name) in the first line next to
    `Policy`.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click `Add policy`.
  </li>
</ol>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::danger
When multiple policies match an entity and they all have equal priorities, the effective one
will be chosen undeterministically. **Such cases should be avoided** by paying attention
to what priorities various policies use.
:::

This matches the value `"all"` with the key
`"federation-upstream-set"` for all exchanges
with names beginning with `"federated."`, in the
virtual host `"/"`.

The `"pattern"` argument is a regular expression used
to match exchange or queue names.

In the event that more than one policy can match a given
exchange or queue, the policy with the greatest priority applies.

The `"apply-to"` argument can be one of the following:

* `"exchanges"`, applies to exchanges only
* `"queues"`, applies to all types of queues, including streams
* `"classic_queues"`, applies to classic queues only
* `"quorum_queues"`, applies to quorum queues only
* `"streams"`, applies to streams only
* `"all"`, applies to all exchanges and queues (including streams)

The `"apply-to"` and `"priority"` settings are optional.
The default values are `"all"` and `"0"` respectively.

### Policy Priorities {#policy-priorities}

Policy **patterns** are matched against exchange and queue **names** to determine what policy (if any)
should then inject a set of key-value pairs (the definition of that policy) into the [optional arguments](./queues#optional-arguments)
of matching queues (exchanges).

**At most one policy matches** a queue or exchange. Since multiple policies can match a single
name, a mechanism is needed to resolve such policy conflicts. This mechanism is called policy priorities.
Every policy has a a numeric priority associated with it. This priority can be specified when declaring
a policy. If not explicitly provided, the priority of 0 (a very low one) will be used.

:::important
**At most one policy matches** a queue or exchange. Matching policies are then sorted by priority
and the one with the highest priority will take
effect.

Higher values indicate higher priority: a policy with priority 10 will overrule a policy with priority 8,
and both will overrule the default priority of 0.
:::

:::danger
When multiple policies match an entity and they all have equal priorities, the effective one
will be chosen undeterministically. **Such cases should be avoided** by paying attention
to what priorities various policies use.

### Combining Policy Definitions {#combining-policy-definitions}

In some cases we might want to apply more than one policy
definition to a resource. For example we might need a queue to
be federated and has message TTL. At most one policy will apply to a
resource at any given time, but we can apply multiple
definitions in that policy.

A federation policy definition would require an <em>upstream set</em>
to be specified, so we would need the `federation-upstream-set`
key in our definition. On the other hand to define some queues as TTL-enabled,
we would need the TTL-related keys key to be defined as well for the
policy. The policy definition is just a JSON object and can have multiple
keys combined in the same policy definition.

Here's an example:

<Tabs groupId="shell-specific">
<TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>
```bash
rabbitmqctl set_policy ttl-fed \
    "^tf\." '{"federation-upstream-set":"all", "message-ttl":60000}' \
    --priority 1 \
    --apply-to queues
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="PowerShell" label="PowerShell">
```PowerShell
rabbitmqctl set_policy ttl-fed ^
    "^tf\." "{""federation-upstream-set"":""all"", ""message-ttl"":60000}" ^
    --priority 1 ^
    --apply-to queues
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="HTTP API" label="HTTP API">
```ini
PUT /api/policies/%2f/ttl-fed
    {"pattern": "^tf\.",
    "definition": {"federation-upstream-set":"all", "message-ttl":60000},
    "priority": 1,
    "apply-to": "queues"}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Management UI" label="Management UI">
<ol>
  <li>
    Navigate to `Admin` > `Policies` > `Add / update a
    policy`.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter a policy name (such as "federated") next to Name, a pattern (such as "^federated\.") next to
    Pattern, and select what kind of entities (queues in this example) the policy should apply to using the `Apply to`
    drop down.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter "federation-upstream-set" = "all" (or a specific upstream name) in the first line next to
    `Policy`.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click `Add policy`.
  </li>
</ol>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

By doing that all the queues matched by the pattern "^tf\\." will have the `"federation-upstream-set"`
and the policy definitions applied to them.

## Operator Policies {#operator-policies}

### Difference From Regular Policies {#why-operator-policies-exist}

Sometimes it is necessary for the operator to enforce certain policies.
For example, it may be desirable to force [queue TTL](./ttl) but
still let other users manage policies. Operator policies allow for that.

Operator policies are much like regular ones but their
definitions are used differently. They are merged with
regular policy definitions before the result is applied to
matching queues.

Because operator policies can unexpectedly change queue
attributes and, in turn, application assumptions and
semantics, they are limited only to a few arguments:

<table>
  <thead>
    <td></td>
    <td><strong>Classic</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Quorum</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Stream</strong></td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <th>delivery-limit</th>
    <td> </td>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>expires</th>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>max-in-memory-bytes</th>
    <td> </td>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>max-in-memory-length</th>
    <td> </td>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>max-length</th>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>max-length-bytes</th>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>message-ttl</th>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>target-group-size</th>
    <td> </td>
    <td> <span>&#10003;</span> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Conflict Resolution with Regular Policies {#operator-policy-conflicts}

An operator policy and a regular policy can contain the same
keys in their definitions. When it happens, the more conservative
value is chosen as effective. For example, if a matching
operator policy definition sets `max-length` to
50 and a matching regular policy definition uses the value of 100,
the value of 50 will be used. If, however, regular policy's value
was 20, it would be used. Operator policies, therefore, don't
just overwrite regular policy values. They enforce limits but
try to not override user-provided policies where possible.

        <td> </td>
    </tr>
</table>

When the same key is provided by both [client-provided `x-arguments`](./queues#optional-arguments) and by a user policy,
the former take precedence. The exception to this rule is `(x-)overflow` for quorum queues where the policy takes precedence.

However, if an operator policy is also used, that will take precedence over the client-provided
arguments, too. Operator policies are a protection mechanism and override client-provided values
and user policy values.

Use operator policies to introduce guardrails for application-controlled parameters related
to resource use (e.g. peak disk space usage).

### Defining Operator Policies {#operator-policy-definition}

Operator policies are defined in a way very similar to regular (user) policies.
When `rabbitmqctl` is used, the command name is `set_operator_policy`
instead of `set_policy`. In the HTTP API, `/api/policies/` in request path
becomes `/api/operator-policies/`:

<Tabs groupId="shell-specific">
<TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>
```bash
rabbitmqctl set_operator_policy transient-queue-ttl \
    "^amq\." '{"expires":1800000}' \
    --priority 1 \
    --apply-to queues
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="PowerShell" label="PowerShell">
```PowerShell
rabbitmqctl.bat set_operator_policy transient-queue-ttl ^
    "^amq\." "{""expires"": 1800000}" ^
    --priority 1 ^
    --apply-to queues
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="HTTP API" label="HTTP API">
```ini
PUT /api/operator-policies/%2f/transient-queue-ttl
                {"pattern": "^amq\.",
                 "definition": {"expires": 1800000},
                 "priority": 1,
                 "apply-to": "queues"}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Management UI" label="Management UI">
<ol>
  <li>
    Navigate to `Admin` > `Policies` > `Add / update an operator
    policy`.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter queue name ("transient-queue-ttl" in this example) next to Name, a pattern ("^amq\." in this example) next to
    `Pattern`, and select what kind of entities (queues in this example) the policy should apply to using the `Apply to`
    drop down.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter "expires" = 1800000 in the first line next to
    `Policy`.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click `Add policy`.
  </li>
</ol>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::danger
When multiple policies match an entity and they all have equal priorities, the effective one
will be chosen undeterministically. **Such cases should be avoided** by paying attention
to what priorities various policies use.

### How to Disable Operator Policy Changes {#disable-operator-policy-changes}

Modification of operator policies via the HTTP API and Web UI can be disabled
in configuration. This makes operator policies read-only for all users via the
HTTP API and Web UI.

```ini
management.restrictions.operator_policy_changes.disabled = true
```

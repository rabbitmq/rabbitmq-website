# RabbitMQ JMS Client

## <a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction">Introduction</a>

RabbitMQ is not a JMS provider but includes [a plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.11.x/deps/rabbitmq_jms_topic_exchange)
needed to support the JMS Queue and Topic messaging models. [JMS Client
for RabbitMQ](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jms-client) implements the JMS specification on top of the
[RabbitMQ Java client](./api-guide), thus allowing new and
existing JMS applications to connect to RabbitMQ.

The plugin and the JMS client are meant to work and be used together.

See the [RabbitMQ Java libraries support page](./java-versions) for the support timeline
of the RabbitMQ JMS Client library.

# RabbitMQ Erlang Client Library Build Instructions

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

This guide covers building RabbitMQ Erlang client from source.


## Building from Source

### <a id="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>

In order to build the client library, you will need a few tools.

RabbitMQ requires a recent version of [Python](http://www.python.org/download/)
for generating AMQP 0-9-1 framing code.

Additionally, you will need

* The [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/downloads)
  development and runtime tools. On a Debian-based
  system then you need the `erlang-nox`, `erlang-dev` and
  `erlang-src` packages installed. See [Erlang Version Requirements guide](./which-erlang) to learn
  about the recommended ways of provisioning a recent supported version of Erlang.
 * A recent version of [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
 * a recent version of [GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
 * a recent version of `xsltproc`, which is part of [libxslt](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/)
 * a recent version of `xmlto`
 * [zip](http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html) and [unzip](http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html)

## Building the Client

The repository is hosted on GitHub. Clone the repository with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-erlang-client.git
```

to build the client, run `make`:

```bash
cd rabbitmq-erlang-client
make
```

This will clone and build all dependencies of the client.



## <a id="targets" class="anchor" href="#targets">Other Make Targets</a>

There are other useful `Makefile` targets available in the repository. They include

<table>
  <thead>
    <td>Target</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </thead>

  <tr>
    <td>all</td>
    <td>The default target. Builds the client library and all of its dependencies.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>shell</td>
    <td>
      Builds the client library and starts an Erlang shell (a REPL) with the
      libraries loaded.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>run-broker</td>
    <td>
      Builds the client and starts a RabbitMQ server node with shell
      and the client included in runtime load path.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>clean</td>
    <td>Removes temporary build products.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>distclean</td>
    <td>Removes all build products.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>tests</td>
    <td>Runs test suites</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>dialyze</td>
    <td>
      Analyses the client source code with dialyzer. Uses PLT
      file from default location:
      <code>~/.dialyzer_plt</code>. Use

```bash
make PLT=/path/to/plt dialyze
```

      to override this. Add broker to PLT beforehand,
      otherwise you will a lot of 'unknown function'
      warnings. See <code>add_broker_to_plt</code> make
      target.

  <tr>
    <td>source-dist</td>
    <td>Creates a source tarball of the library under <code>./PACKAGES</code>.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>package</td>
    <td>Creates an Erlang archive (binary build) of the library under <code>./PACKAGES</code>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

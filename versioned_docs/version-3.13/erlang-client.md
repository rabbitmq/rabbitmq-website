# Erlang RabbitMQ client Library

The RabbitMQ Erlang client library allows Erlang and Elixir applications
to connect to and interact with RabbitMQ nodes.

The library is [open-source](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-erlang-client/),
and is dual-licensed under [the Apache License v2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
and [the Mozilla Public License v2.0](./mpl).


## <a id="releases" class="anchor" href="#releases">Releases</a>

The client library is named `amqp_client` and [distributed via Hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/amqp_client)
together with its key dependency, [`rabbit-common`](https://hex.pm/packages/rabbit_common).

```

### Rebar 3

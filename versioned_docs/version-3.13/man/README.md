# RabbitMQ man Pages

## Source Files

These pages contain source files that reside in the [server repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.13.x/deps/rabbit/docs).

After cloning that repository in addition to this one and check out the appropriate branch, you can regenerate the
HTML manpages using the `update-manpages.sh` script:

```sh
./website/versioned_docs/version-3.13/man/update-manpages.sh /path/to/rabbitmq-server
```

The script takes care of calling make(1) to generate the files.

## Contributions

Since these files are generated, it is important to keep them in sync with the source.
Accepting community contributions — which will always come as website pull requests —
is fine but the person who merges them is responsible for backporting all changes
to the source pages.


## Adding a New Man Page

When a new man page is added, its contents as generated by `mandoc` have to
be copied into this directory. A new wrapper DocBook page must be added
to the parent (`site`) directory, see `site/rabbitmq-diagnostics.8.xml` for example.

# Firehose Tracer

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

Sometimes, during development or debugging, it's useful to
be able to see every message that is published, and every
message that is delivered. RabbitMQ has a "firehose"
feature, where the administrator can turn on (on a per-node,
per-vhost basis) an exchange to which publish- and
delivery-notifications should be CCed.

These notifications are close to what's happening on the
wire - for example you will see unacked messages.

When the feature is turned off, it has no effect on
performance; when it is turned on, performance will drop
somewhat due to additional messages being generated and
routed.

## <a id="enabling" class="anchor" href="#enabling">Turning on firehose</a>


Before turning on the feature, decide which node, and which vhost, should have it turned on.
The following examples assume the default vhost, "`/`", and the default node
"`rabbit@(hostname)`". Use the
`-n` argument to specify a node other than,
and the `-p` argument to specify another
vhost.

Next, within the chosen vhost declare queues, bind them to the
topic exchange `amq.rabbitmq.trace`, and
begin consuming.

Finally, to turn on firehose tracing with

```bash
rabbitmqctl trace_on -p [virtual host]
```.


## <a id="disabling" class="anchor" href="#disabling">Turn off firehose</a>

To turn off Firehose, run

```bash
rabbitmqctl trace_off -p [virtual host]
```

Don't forget to clean up any queues that were used to consume events from the Firehose.

Note that the firehose state is not persistent; it will
default of off at server start time.


## <a id="format" class="anchor" href="#format">Firehose Event Message Format</a>

The firehose publishes messages to the topic exchange
`amq.rabbitmq.trace`. In this section we refer to the messages consumed and inspected
via the Firehose mechanism as "traced messages".

Traced message routing key will be either "`publish.{exchangename}`" (for messages
entering the node), or "`deliver.{queuename}`" (for messages that are delivered to consumers).

Traced message headers containing metadata about the original message:

<table>
  <tr><th>Header</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>exchange_name</td>
    <td>longstr</td>
    <td>
      name of the exchange to which the message was
      published
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>routing_keys</td>
    <td>array</td>
    <td>
      routing key plus contents of
      <a href="./sender-selected">`CC` and
      `BCC` headers</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>properties</td>
    <td>table</td>
    <td><a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#class.basic">content properties</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>node</td>
    <td>longstr</td>
    <td>Erlang node on which the trace message was generated</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>redelivered</td>
    <td>signedint</td>
    <td>
      whether the message has its redelivered flag set
      (messages leaving the broker only)
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Traced message body corresponding to the body of the original message.


## <a id="tracing-plugin" class="anchor" href="#tracing-plugin">Tracing plugin</a>

The `rabbitmq_tracing` <a href="./plugins">plugin</a> builds on top of the tracer
and provides a GUI to capture traced messages and log them
in text or JSON format files.

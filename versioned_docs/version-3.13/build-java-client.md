# Build RabbitMQ Java Client from Source

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

This guides describes the process of building the Java client library from source.

The repository is hosted on GitHub. Clone two repositories with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-codegen.git rabbitmq_codegen
git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client.git
```

The code generation repository is a dependency of
the Java client library.


## <a id="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites">Required Libraries and Tools</a>

In order to build RabbitMQ Java client, you will need a few tools.

The first one is a recent version of [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) and
[simplejson.py](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson)
in order to drive code generation.

Additionally, for building the Java client libraries, you will need

 * [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or newer
 * [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) version 3.3.x or newer.


## <a id="building" class="anchor" href="#building">Building</a>

Ensure <code>JAVA_HOME</code> is correctly set and
that the <code>rabbitmq-java-client</code> and
<code>rabbitmq_codegen</code> directories are in
the same directory. Then, from the <code>rabbitmq-java-client</code> directory, run

```bash
cd rabbitmq-java-client

./mvnw clean package -Ddeps.dir=../ -DskipTests
```

The generated JAR file will be in <code>target</code> directory.


## <a id="contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing">Contributing</a>

If you are looking to contribute to the client, take a look at these
[instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client#contributing).

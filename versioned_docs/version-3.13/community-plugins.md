# Community Plugins

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

Binary downloads of plugins, which are contributed by authors in the
community are available. These plugins do not ship with the RabbitMQ
server. Refer to [Installing Additional Plugins](./installing-plugins) for information on how to install the plugins. Note, the latest
build of the plugin is compiled against the latest feature release of RabbitMQ. 

There is no guarantee that these plugins work
against a given release of RabbitMQ. They are built at
release time, and also when requested by a plugin
author.

Bugfix releases usually do not affect plugin compatibility.

When RabbitMQ is upgraded, all community plugins must be re-installed, which can result in installing newer versions of them.
Alternatively, they can be deactivated before or during the upgrade.

If you are the author of a plugin and would like it listed
here, [get in touch](./contact)!

  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      The last value exchange acts like a direct exchange (binding
      keys are compared for equality with routing keys); but it
      also keeps track of the last value that was published with
      each routing key, and when a queue is bound, it
      automatically enqueues the last value for the binding key.

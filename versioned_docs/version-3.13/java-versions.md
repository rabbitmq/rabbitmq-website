(1) Includes backport of features (if possible), bug and security fixes for non-latest production branches.

(2) Includes only security patches. The library reaches end of life (EOL) once the extended support period ends.

(3) Long-Term Support (LTS) releases of the JDK are fully supported (currently JDK 8, 11, 17, and 21).
Intermediate releases (e.g. 20 and 22) are supported on a best-effort basis, meaning bug reports are accepted and addressed as far as technically possible but without any service level guarantees.

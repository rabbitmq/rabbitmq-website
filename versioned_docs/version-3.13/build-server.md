# Server Build Instructions

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

This section describes the process for obtaining a copy of the
RabbitMQ server source code, as well as instructions for building the
server from source.


## <a id="git" class="anchor" href="#git">Build from Git</a>

First, get the source code from [our GitHub repositories](./github):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server.git rabbitmq
```

Then, use GNU Make to pull down dependencies and build the server and all plugins
that ship with the RabbitMQ distribution:

```bash
cd rabbitmq
make
```


## <a id="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites">Required Libraries and Tools</a>

In order to build RabbitMQ, a few tools must be installed.

### Python

RabbitMQ requires a recent version of [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) and [simplejson.py](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson)
(an implementation of a [JSON](http://json.org) reader
and writer in Python), for generating AMQP 0-9-1 framing code.
simplejson.py is included as a standard json library in the Python
core since 2.6 release.

### Erlang/OTP Toolchain and Headers

The [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/./download) development and runtime tools
are needed to compile RabbitMQ server, tools and [tier 1 plugins](./plugins).

On a Debian-based system, install the `erlang-nox`, `erlang-dev` and
`erlang-src` packages.

See [Erlang compatibility guide](./which-erlang) to learn more about supported versions of Erlang/OTP.

### Elixir

A recent version of [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) is needed
to build [RabbitMQ CLI tools](./cli).

### GNU Make

[GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is the primary build tool
used by RabbitMQ.

### xsltproc and xmlto

A recent version of <i>xsltproc</i>, which is part of [libxslt](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/) and
<i>xmlto</i> must be available.

### zip and unzip

[zip](http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html) and [unzip](http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html)
would be necessary if source code is obtained via an archive instead of a git repository clone.


## <a id="building-server" class="anchor" href="#building-server">Building the Server</a>

Change to the `rabbitmq` directory, and type `make`.

Other interesting `Makefile` targets include

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Make Target</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>all</td>
      <td>
        The default target. Builds the server.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>shell</td>
      <td>
        Builds the client libraries and starts an Erlang shell with the
        libraries loaded.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>run-broker</td>
      <td>
        Builds the server and starts an instance with an
        interactive Erlang shell. This will by default put
        data, including the node's data directory, under <code>/tmp/rabbitmq-test-instances</code>,
        but this location can be overridden by setting the
        Makefile variable <code>TEST_TMPDIR</code>:

```bash
make run-broker TEST_TMPDIR="/some/other/location/for/rabbitmq-test-instances"
```

        The Erlang node name can also be changed by setting
        <code>RABBITMQ_NODENAME</code>:

```bash
make run-broker RABBITMQ_NODENAME=rmq
```

        See <a href="./configure">Configuration guide</a> for other
        variables that may be useful.

    <tr>
      <td>tests</td>
      <td>
        Runs multiple server test suites. This is very resource-intensive and will
        take up to a few hours. Many nodes and clusters will be started, modified and destroyed
        by various test suites.

## <a id="building-packages" class="anchor" href="#building-packages">Building Packages</a>

In practice, building RabbitMQ server from source is of limited use
unless an easy to deploy package (e.g. a generic binary build or Debian one) can be produced.

Everything related to packaging the RabbitMQ server is in the [main RabbitMQ repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server).

There is a number of top-level packaging Make targets available, one for each package
type (or family of packages, such as RPM):

 * `make package-generic-unix`
 * `make package-deb`
 * `make package-rpm`
 * `make package-rpm-suse`
 * `make package-windows`

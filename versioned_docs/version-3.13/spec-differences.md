    <h1>Spec Differences</h1>
    <h2>Undeprecated Features</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to extensions beyond the specification, RabbitMQ also undeprecates some features that were removed from AMQP 0-9-1.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./amqp-0-9-1-reference#exchange.declare.auto-delete">Auto-delete exchanges</a></li>
        <li><a href="./amqp-0-9-1-reference#exchange.declare.internal">Internal exchanges</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The access class was deprecated from AMQP 0-9-1. RabbitMQ implements the
        <span class="code">access.request</span> method from this class as a no-op in order to maintain compatibility with older clients. This method will be removed in the future and should not be relied upon.
    </p>

    <h2>amq.* Exchange Immutability</h2>
    <p>AMQP 0-9-1 spec dictates that it must not be possible to declare an exchange with the <span class="code">amq.</span> prefix. RabbitMQ also prohibits deletion of such exchanges.</p>

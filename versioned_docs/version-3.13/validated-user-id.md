# Validated User-ID

In some scenarios it is useful for consumers to be able
to know the identity of the user who published a
message. We have therefore made sure that
the <code>user-id</code> message property is validated. If
this property is set by a publisher, its value must be equal
to the name of the user used to open the connection. If
the <code>user-id</code> property is not set, the
publisher's identity remains private.

For example (in Java):

```java
AMQP.BasicProperties properties = new AMQP.BasicProperties();
properties.setUserId("guest");
channel.basicPublish("amq.fanout", "", properties, "test".getBytes());
```

This message will only be published successfully if the user
is "guest".

If security is a serious concern, you should probably
combine the use of this feature
with [TLS-enabled](./ssl) connections.

Occasionally it may be useful to allow an application to forge a
user-id. In order to permit this, the publishing user can have
its <code>impersonator</code> tag set. By default, no users have
this tag set. In particular, the <code>administrator</code> tag
does not allow this.

The [federation plugin](./federation) can deliver
messages from an upstream on which the <code>user-id</code>
property is set. By default it will clear this property (since
it has no way to know whether the upstream broker is
trustworthy). If the <code>trust-user-id</code> property on an
upstream is set, then it will pass the <code>user-id</code>
property through from the upstream broker, assuming it to have
been validated there.

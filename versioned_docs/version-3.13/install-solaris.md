# Installing on Solaris

The [Generic binary build](./install-generic-unix) installation instructions may be used to install
RabbitMQ on Solaris, with two modifications.


The RabbitMQ shell scripts assume a standard POSIX environment.
On Solaris this requires that startup scripts be executed with
the `/usr/xpg4/bin/sh` shell. This can
be accomplished by replacing the first line of each script
(which normally reads `#!/bin/sh`) with `#!/usr/xpg4/bin/sh`.

The RabbitMQ shell scripts assume the existence of the
"readlink" utility for resolving symbolic links. This can be
obtained by installing the
[Sunfreeware](http://www.sunfreeware.com/)
"coreutils" package or compiling
[GNU coreutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/).

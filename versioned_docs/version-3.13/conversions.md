## Overview {#overview}

RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol broker supporting [AMQP 1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-overview-v1.0-os.html)
(henceforth AMQP), [AMQP 0.9.1](/resources/specs/amqp0-9-1.pdf),
[MQTT](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html), [STOMP](https://stomp.github.io/),
and the [RabbitMQ Streams](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbitmq_stream/docs/PROTOCOL.adoc) protocols.
Messages can readily be published by one protocol and consumed by others.
This necessitates data format conversions between different protocol formats.
Prior to RabbitMQ 3.13 all messages were converted into an internal format based
on the AMQP 0.9.1 protocol when published to RabbitMQ. This approach often resulted in unnecessary
conversions and/or data fidelity issues.

Since RabbitMQ 3.13 the approach has changed for the AMQP 0.9.1 and MQTT protocols
in that messages will always be stored in their original format and only converted
_if_ consumed by a protocol different from the originating protocol. This has the advantage
that no protocol specific information is lost when the originating and the consuming protocols
are the same.

The only exception to this rule are [streams](./streams): No matter which protocol published,
streams internally store their messages as AMQP 1.0 encoded data. Hence, when for example publishing using AMQP 0.9.1
a conversion to AMQP takes place.

All conversions have been re-written and formalised.
This document aims to capture the conversions rules that are implemented so that
application developers can look back at this to understand how their messages
will be transformed in their multi-protocol messaging applications.


## Conventions {#conventions}

`shortstr`: (condition) a string that is smaller than 256 bytes and contains only valid
UTF-8 encoded data with no `NUL` (binary zero octet) characters.

`*`: is read as "any" (field/type etc).

Conditions can be read to be evaluated in the order they are written. For example
an AMQP `message_id` of type `utf8` with more than 255 bytes will fail the first
`shortstr` condition and then fall through to the next line.
If there is no matching line then the data will not be converted (and therefore not be
available to the consuming application).

## AMQP 0.9.1 {#amqp-amqpl}

In RabbitMQ 3.13 the AMQP (1.0) plugin does not implement these conversion rules yet
and they are only used when reading from a stream. However they will be used
as of RabbitMQ 4.0+.

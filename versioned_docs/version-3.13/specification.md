        <p>RabbitMQ implements version 0-9-1 of the AMQP specification in the core, with a number of <a href="./extensions">extensions</a> to the specification.</p>
        <p>
            RabbitMQ implements AMQP 1.0 via a <a href="./plugins">plugin</a>. However, AMQP 1.0 is a completely different protocol than AMQP 0-9-1 and hence not a suitable replacement for the latter. RabbitMQ will therefore continue to
            support AMQP 0-9-1 indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 0-9-1 (with and without extensions) specifications are linked to below for your convenience. We recommend reading them if you want to learn more about AMQP 0-9-1. Please see our
            <a href="./tutorials/amqp-concepts">AMQP 0-9-1 Overview guide</a>, <a href="./amqp-0-9-1-reference">AMQP 0-9-1 Reference guide</a>, and the rest of <a href="./documentation">documentation</a> for more information.

            AMQP 1.0 introduced significant changes to the spec compared to 0-9-1, and at least in RabbitMQ, considered to be a separate protocol, support for which is provided using a plugin.

                            possible, to move the message to a dead-letter queue. The server MAY use more sophisticated tracking to hold the message on the queue and redeliver it to the same client at a later stage.

# AMQP 0-9-1 Model Explained

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

This guide provides an overview of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol, one of the protocols
supported by RabbitMQ.

## <a id="highlevel-overview" class="anchor" href="#highlevel-overview">High-level Overview of AMQP 0-9-1 and the AMQP Model</a>

### <a id="what-is-amqp" class="anchor" href="#what-is-amqp">What is AMQP 0-9-1?</a>

AMQP 0-9-1 (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is a messaging
protocol that enables conforming client applications to
communicate with conforming messaging middleware brokers.

### <a id="brokers-role" class="anchor" href="#brokers-role">Brokers and Their Role</a>

Messaging brokers receive messages from _[publishers](../publishers)_
(applications that publish them, also known as producers) and route them to
_[consumers](../consumers)_ (applications that process them).

Since it is a network protocol, the publishers,
consumers and the broker can all reside on
different machines.

### <a id="amqp-model" class="anchor" href="#amqp-model">AMQP 0-9-1 Model in Brief</a>

The AMQP 0-9-1 Model has the following view of the world:
messages are published to _exchanges_,
which are often compared to post offices or mailboxes. Exchanges then
distribute message copies to _queues_ using rules called
_bindings_. Then the broker either deliver messages to
consumers subscribed to queues, or consumers
fetch/pull messages from queues on demand.

<img src="../img/tutorials/intro/hello-world-example-routing.png" alt="Publish path from publisher to consumer via exchange and queue" />

When publishing a message, publishers may specify various
_message attributes_ (message meta-data). Some of this
meta-data may be used by the broker, however, the rest of it
is completely opaque to the broker and is only used by
applications that receive the message.

Networks are unreliable and applications may fail to process
messages therefore the AMQP 0-9-1 model has a notion of
_message acknowledgements_: when a message is delivered
to a consumer the consumer _notifies the broker_,
either automatically or as soon as the application
developer chooses to do so. When message acknowledgements
are in use, a broker will only completely remove a message
from a queue when it receives a notification for that message
(or group of messages).

In certain situations, for example, when a message cannot
be routed, messages may be _returned_ to publishers,
dropped, or, if the broker implements an extension,
placed into a so-called "dead letter queue". Publishers choose
how to handle situations like this by publishing messages
using certain parameters.

Queues, exchanges and bindings are collectively referred to as _AMQP entities_.

### <a id="programmable-protocol" class="anchor" href="#programmable-protocol">AMQP 0-9-1 is a Programmable Protocol</a>

AMQP 0-9-1 is a programmable protocol in the sense that AMQP 0-9-1
entities and routing schemes are primarily defined by applications
themselves, not a broker administrator. Accordingly,
provision is made for protocol operations that declare
queues and exchanges, define bindings between them,
subscribe to [queues](../queues) and so on.

This gives application developers a lot of freedom but
also requires them to be aware of potential definition
conflicts. In practice, definition conflicts are rare and
often indicate a misconfiguration.

Applications declare the AMQP 0-9-1 entities that they need,
define necessary routing schemes and may choose to delete
AMQP 0-9-1 entities when they are no longer used.


## <a id="exchanges" class="anchor" href="#exchanges">Exchanges and Exchange Types</a>

_Exchanges_ are AMQP 0-9-1 entities where messages are
sent to. Exchanges take a message and route it into zero or
more queues. The routing algorithm used depends on the
_exchange type_ and rules called _bindings_.
AMQP 0-9-1 brokers provide four exchange types:

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Exchange type</th>
    <th>Default pre-declared names</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Direct exchange</td>
    <td>(Empty string) and amq.direct</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanout exchange</td>
    <td>amq.fanout</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Topic exchange</td>
    <td>amq.topic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Headers exchange</td>
    <td>amq.match (and amq.headers in RabbitMQ)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Besides the exchange type, exchanges are declared with a number of
attributes, the most important of which are:

 * Name
 * Durability (exchanges survive broker restart)
 * Auto-delete (exchange is deleted when last queue is unbound from it)
 * Arguments (optional, used by plugins and broker-specific features)

Exchanges can be durable or transient. Durable
exchanges survive broker restart whereas transient
exchanges do not (they have to be redeclared
when broker comes back online). Not all scenarios
and use cases require exchanges to be durable.

### <a id="exchange-default" class="anchor" href="#exchange-default">Default Exchange</a>

The default exchange is a direct exchange with no name
(empty string) pre-declared by the broker. It has one special
property that makes it very useful for simple applications:
every queue that is created is automatically bound to it with
a routing key which is the same as the queue name.

For example, when you declare a queue with the name of
"search-indexing-online", the AMQP 0-9-1 broker will bind it
to the default exchange using "search-indexing-online" as
the routing key (in this context sometimes referred to as the binding key).
Therefore, a message published to the default
exchange with the routing key "search-indexing-online"
will be routed to the queue "search-indexing-online". In
other words, the default exchange makes it seem like it
is possible to deliver messages directly to queues, even
though that is not technically what is happening.

### <a id="exchange-direct" class="anchor" href="#exchange-direct">Direct Exchange</a>

A direct exchange delivers messages to queues based on the
message routing key. A direct exchange is ideal for the unicast
routing of messages. They can be used for multicast
routing as well.

Here is how it works:

 * A queue binds to the exchange with a routing key K
 * When a new message with routing key R arrives at the
   direct exchange, the exchange routes it to the queue if K = R
 * If multiple queues are bound to a direct exchange with the same
   routing key K, the exchange will route the message to all queues
   for which K = R

A direct exchange can be represented graphically as follows:

<img src="../img/tutorials/intro/exchange-direct.png" alt="exchange delivering messages to  queues based on routing key" />

### <a id="exchange-fanout" class="anchor" href="#exchange-fanout">Fanout Exchange</a>

A fanout exchange routes messages to all of the queues
that are bound to it and the routing key is ignored. If N
queues are bound to a fanout exchange, when a new message
is published to that exchange a copy of the message is
delivered to all N queues. Fanout exchanges are ideal for
the broadcast routing of messages.

Because a fanout exchange delivers a copy of a message to
every queue bound to it, its use cases are quite similar:

 * Massively multi-player online (MMO) games can use it
   for leaderboard updates or other global events
 * Sport news sites can use fanout exchanges for
   distributing score updates to mobile clients in near
   real-time
 * Distributed systems can broadcast various state and
   configuration updates
 * Group chats can distribute messages between participants
   using a fanout exchange (although AMQP does not have a
   built-in concept of presence, so XMPP may be a better choice)

A fanout exchange can be represented graphically as follows:

<img src="../img/tutorials/intro/exchange-fanout.png" alt="exchange delivering messages to three queues" />

### <a id="exchange-topic" class="anchor" href="#exchange-topic">Topic Exchange</a>

Topic exchanges route messages to one or many queues
based on matching between a message routing key and the
pattern that was used to bind a queue to an exchange. The
topic exchange type is often used to implement various
publish/subscribe pattern variations. Topic exchanges are
commonly used for the multicast routing of messages.

Topic exchanges have a very broad set of use cases. Whenever
a problem involves multiple consumers/applications that
selectively choose which type of messages they want to
receive, the use of topic exchanges should be considered.

Example uses:

* Distributing data relevant to specific geographic
  location, for example, points of sale
* Background task processing done by multiple workers,
  each capable of handling specific set of tasks
* Stocks price updates (and updates on other kinds of financial data)
* News updates that involve categorization or tagging
  (for example, only for a particular sport or team)
* Orchestration of services of different kinds in the cloud
* Distributed architecture/OS-specific software builds or
  packaging where each builder can handle only one architecture or OS

### <a id="exchange-headers" class="anchor" href="#exchange-headers">Headers Exchange</a>

A headers exchange is designed for routing on multiple
attributes that are more easily expressed as message
headers than a routing key. Headers exchanges ignore the
routing key attribute. Instead, the attributes used for
routing are taken from the headers attribute. A message is
considered matching if the value of the header equals the
value specified upon binding.

It is possible to bind a queue to a headers exchange using
more than one header for matching. In this case, the broker
needs one more piece of information from the application
developer, namely, should it consider messages with any
of the headers matching, or all of them? This is what the
"x-match" binding argument is for. When the "x-match"
argument is set to "any", just one matching header value
is sufficient. Alternatively, setting "x-match" to "all"
mandates that all the values must match.

For "any" and "all", headers beginning with the string `x-`
will not be used to evaluate matches.
Setting "x-match" to "any-with-x" or "all-with-x" will also use headers
beginning with the string `x-` to evaluate matches.

Headers exchanges can be looked upon as "direct exchanges
on steroids". Because they route based on header values,
they can be used as direct exchanges where the routing key
does not have to be a string; it could be an integer or a
hash (dictionary) for example.

## <a id="queues" class="anchor" href="#queues">Queues</a>

[Queues](../queues) in the AMQP 0-9-1 model are very similar to queues in
other message- and task-queueing systems: they store
messages that are consumed by applications. Queues share
some properties with exchanges, but also have some additional
properties:

 * Name
 * Durable (the queue will survive a broker restart)
 * Exclusive (used by only one connection and the queue will be deleted when that connection closes)
 * Auto-delete (queue that has had at least one consumer is deleted when last consumer unsubscribes)
 * Arguments (optional; used by plugins and broker-specific features such as message TTL, queue length limit, etc)

Before a queue can be used it has to be declared. Declaring
a queue will cause it to be created if it does not already
exist. The declaration will have no effect if the queue does
already exist and its attributes are the same as those in the
declaration. When the existing queue attributes are not the
same as those in the declaration a channel-level exception
with code 406 (`PRECONDITION_FAILED`) will be  raised.

### <a id="queue-names" class="anchor" href="#queue-names">Queue Names</a>

Applications may pick queue names or ask the broker to generate
a name for them.  Queue names may be up to 255 bytes of UTF-8
characters. An AMQP 0-9-1 broker can generate a unique queue
name on behalf of an app. To use this feature, pass an empty
string as the queue name argument. The generated name will be returned
to the client with queue declaration response.

Queue names starting with "amq." are reserved for internal
use by the broker. Attempts to declare a queue with a name that
violates this rule will result in a channel-level exception
with reply code 403 (`ACCESS_REFUSED`).

### <a id="queue-durability" class="anchor" href="#queue-durability">Queue Durability</a>

In AMQP 0-9-1, queues can be declared as durable or transient.
Metadata of a durable queue is stored on disk, while metadata of a transient queue is
stored in memory when possible.

The same distinction is made for [messages at publishing time](../publishers#message-properties).

In environments and use cases where durability is important, applications
must use durable queues *and* make sure that publish mark published messages as persisted.

This topic is covered in more detailed in the [Queues guide](../queues#durability).


## <a id="bindings" class="anchor" href="#bindings">Bindings</a>

Bindings are rules that exchanges use (among other things)
to route messages to queues. To instruct an exchange E to
route messages to a queue Q,
Q has to be _bound_ to E. Bindings may have an optional
_routing key_ attribute used by some exchange types. The
purpose of the routing key is to select certain messages published
to an exchange to be routed to the bound queue. In other words,
the routing key acts like a filter.

To draw an analogy:

 * Queue is like your destination in New York city
 * Exchange is like JFK airport
 * Bindings are routes from JFK to your destination. There can be zero or many ways to reach it

Having this layer of indirection enables routing scenarios
that are impossible or very hard to implement using publishing
directly to queues and also eliminates certain amount of
duplicated work application developers have to do.

If a message cannot be routed to any queue (for example,
because there are no bindings for the exchange it was published
to) it is either [dropped or returned to the publisher](../publishers#unroutable),
depending on message attributes the publisher has set.


## <a id="consumers" class="anchor" href="#consumers">Consumers</a>

Storing messages in queues is useless unless applications
can _[consume](../consumers)_ them. In the AMQP 0-9-1 Model, there
are two ways for applications to do this:

 * Subscribe to have messages delivered to them ("push API"): this is the recommended option
 * Polling ("pull API"): this way is **highly inefficient** and **should be avoided** in most cases

With the "push API", applications have to indicate interest in
consuming messages from a particular queue. When they do so,
we say that they _register a consumer_
or, simply put, _subscribe to a queue_. It is possible
to have more than one consumer per queue or to register an
_exclusive consumer_ (excludes all other consumers from
the queue while it is consuming).

Each consumer (subscription) has an identifier called a
_consumer tag_. It can be used to unsubscribe from
messages. Consumer tags are just strings.

### <a id="consumer-acknowledgements" class="anchor" href="#consumer-acknowledgements">Message Acknowledgements</a>

[Consumer applications](../consumers) – that is, applications that receive and process
messages – may occasionally fail to process individual
messages, lose connection to the server or fail in many other ways.

There is also the possibility
of network issues causing problems. This raises a question:
when should the broker remove messages from queues? The
AMQP 0-9-1 specification gives consumers control over this. There are
two [acknowledgement modes](../confirms):

 * After broker sends a message to an application (using either `basic.deliver` or `basic.get-ok` method).
 * After the application sends back an acknowledgement (using the `basic.ack` method).

The former choice is called the automatic acknowledgement
model, while the latter is called the explicit acknowledgement
model. With the explicit model the application chooses when
it is time to send an acknowledgement. It can be right after
receiving a message, or after persisting it to a data store
before processing, or after fully processing the message
(for example, successfully fetching a Web page, processing
and storing it into some persistent data store).

If a consumer dies without sending an acknowledgement,
the broker will redeliver it to another consumer or,
if none are available at the time, the broker will wait until
at least one consumer is registered for the same queue before
attempting redelivery.

### <a id="messages-reject" class="anchor" href="#messages-reject">Rejecting Messages</a>

When a consumer application receives a message, processing
of that message may or may not succeed. An application can
indicate to the broker that message processing has failed
(or cannot be accomplished at the time) by rejecting a
message. When rejecting a message, an application can ask
the broker to discard or requeue it. When there is only one
consumer on a queue, make sure you do not create infinite
message delivery loops by rejecting and requeueing a message
from the same consumer over and over again.

### <a id="messages-nack" class="anchor" href="#messages-nack">Negative Acknowledgements </a>

Messages are rejected with the `basic.reject` method.
There is one limitation that `basic.reject` has:
there is no way to reject multiple messages as you can do
with acknowledgements. However, if you are using RabbitMQ,
then there is a solution. RabbitMQ provides an AMQP 0-9-1
extension known as _negative acknowledgements_ or _nacks_. For
more information, please refer to the [Confirmations](../confirms)
and [basic.nack extension](../nack) guides.

### <a id="messages-prefetch" class="anchor" href="#messages-prefetch">Prefetching Messages</a>

For cases when multiple consumers share a queue, it is useful
to be able to specify how many messages each consumer can be
sent at once before sending the next acknowledgement. This can
be used as a simple load balancing technique or to improve
throughput if messages tend to be published in batches. For
example, if a producing application sends messages every
minute because of the nature of the work it is doing.

Note that RabbitMQ only supports channel-level prefetch-count,
not connection or size based prefetching.


## <a id="messages" class="anchor" href="#messages">Message Attributes and Payload</a>

Messages in the AMQP 0-9-1 model have _attributes_. Some
attributes are so common that the AMQP 0-9-1 specification
defines them and application developers do not have to think
about the exact attribute name. Some examples are

 * Content type
 * Content encoding
 * Routing key
 * Delivery mode (persistent or not)
 * Message priority
 * Message publishing timestamp
 * Expiration period
 * Publisher application id

Some attributes are used by AMQP brokers, but most are open
to interpretation by applications that receive them. Some
attributes are optional and known
as _headers_. They are similar to X-Headers in
HTTP. Message attributes are set when a message is published.

Messages also have a _payload_ (the data that
they carry), which AMQP brokers treat as an opaque byte array.
The broker will not inspect or modify the payload. It is possible
for messages to contain only attributes and no payload. It
is common to use serialisation formats like JSON, Thrift,
Protocol Buffers and MessagePack to serialize structured data
in order to publish it as the message payload. Protocol peers
typically use the "content-type" and "content-encoding" fields to
communicate this information,  but this is by convention only.

Messages may be published as persistent, which makes the broker persist them to disk.
If the server is restarted the system ensures that received persistent messages are not
lost. Simply publishing a message to a durable exchange or the
fact that the queue(s) it is routed to are durable doesn't make
a message persistent: it all depends on persistence mode of the
message itself. Publishing messages as persistent affects
performance (just like with data stores, durability comes at a
certain cost in performance).

Learn more in the [Publishers guide](../publishers).


## <a id="amqp-methods" class="anchor" href="#amqp-methods">AMQP 0-9-1 Methods</a>

AMQP 0-9-1 is structured as a number of
_methods_. Methods are operations (like HTTP methods)
and have nothing in common with methods in object-oriented
programming languages. Protocol methods in AMQP 0-9-1 are grouped into
_classes_. Classes are just logical groupings of AMQP
methods. The [AMQP 0-9-1 reference](../amqp-0-9-1-reference) has full details of all the AMQP methods.

Let us take a look at the _exchange_ class, a group
of methods related to operations on exchanges. It includes
the following operations:

 * `exchange.declare`
 * `exchange.declare-ok`
 * `exchange.delete`
 * `exchange.delete-ok`

(note that the RabbitMQ site reference also includes
RabbitMQ-specific extensions to the exchange class that we
will not discuss in this guide).

The operations above form logical pairs:
`exchange.declare` and
`exchange.declare-ok`,
`exchange.delete` and
`exchange.delete-ok`. These operations are
"requests" (sent by clients) and "responses" (sent by
brokers in response to the aforementioned "requests").

As an example, the client asks the broker to declare a new
exchange using the `exchange.declare` method:

<img src="../img/tutorials/intro/exchange-declare.png" alt="exchange.declare" />

As shown on the diagram above,
`exchange.declare` carries several
_parameters_. They enable the client to specify
exchange name, type, durability flag and so on.

If the operation succeeds, the broker responds with the `exchange.declare-ok` method:

<img src="../img/tutorials/intro/exchange-declare-ok.png" alt="exchange.declare-ok" />

`exchange.declare-ok` does not carry any
parameters except for the channel number (channels will be
described later in this guide).

The sequence of events is very similar for another
method pair on the AMQP 0-9-1 _queue_ method class: `queue.declare` and
`queue.declare-ok`:

<img src="../img/tutorials/intro/queue-declare.png" alt="queue.declare" />

<img src="../img/tutorials/intro/queue-declare-ok.png" alt="queue.declare-ok" />

Not all AMQP 0-9-1 methods have counterparts. Some
(`basic.publish` being the most widely used one)
do not have corresponding "response" methods
and some others (`basic.get`, for example)
have more than one possible "response".


## <a id="amqp-connections" class="anchor" href="#amqp-connections">Connections</a>

AMQP 0-9-1 connections are typically long-lived. AMQP 0-9-1 is an
application level protocol that uses TCP for reliable
delivery. Connections use authentication and can be
protected using TLS. When an application no longer needs
to be connected to the server, it should gracefully close
its AMQP 0-9-1 connection instead of abruptly closing the underlying TCP connection.


## <a id="amqp-channels" class="anchor" href="#amqp-channels">Channels</a>

Some applications need multiple connections to the
broker. However, it is undesirable to keep many TCP
connections open at the same time because doing so consumes
system resources and makes it more difficult to configure
firewalls. AMQP 0-9-1 connections are multiplexed with
_[channels](../channels)_ that can be thought of as "lightweight
connections that share a single TCP connection".

Every protocol operation performed by a client happens on a channel.
Communication on a particular channel is completely separate
from communication on another channel, therefore every protocol
method also carries a channel ID (a.k.a. channel number), an integer
that both the broker and clients use to figure out which channel the method is for.

A channel only exists in the context of a connection and never on its own.
When a connection is closed, so are all channels on it.

For applications that use multiple threads/processes for
processing, it is very common to open a new channel per thread/process
and not share channels between them.


## <a id="amqp-vhosts" class="anchor" href="#amqp-vhosts">Virtual Hosts</a>

To make it possible for a single broker to host multiple
isolated "environments" (groups of users, exchanges,
queues and so on), AMQP 0-9-1 includes the concept of _[virtual hosts](../vhosts)_ (vhosts).
They are similar to virtual hosts used by many popular Web servers and provide completely isolated
environments in which AMQP entities live. Protocol clients
specify what vhosts they want to use during connection negotiation.


## <a id="amqp-extensibility" class="anchor" href="#amqp-extensibility">AMQP is Extensible</a>

AMQP 0-9-1 has several extension points:

 * [Custom exchange types](../devtools#miscellaneous) let developers
   implement routing schemes that exchange types provided out-of-the-box do
   not cover well, for example, geodata-based routing.
 * Declaration of exchanges and queues can include additional attributes that the broker
   can use. For example, [per-queue message TTL](../ttl) in RabbitMQ is implemented this way.
 * Broker-specific extensions to the protocol. See, for example,
   [extensions that RabbitMQ implements](../extensions).
 * [New AMQP 0-9-1 method classes](../amqp-0-9-1-quickref#class.confirm) can be introduced.
 * Brokers can be extended with [additional plugins](../plugins),
   for example, the [RabbitMQ management](../management)
   frontend and HTTP API are implemented as a plugin.

These features make the AMQP 0-9-1 Model even more flexible
and applicable to a very broad range of problems.


## <a id="amqp-clients" class="anchor" href="#amqp-clients">AMQP 0-9-1 Clients Ecosystem</a>

There are [many AMQP 0-9-1 clients](../devtools) for many
popular programming languages and platforms. Some of them follow AMQP terminology
closely and only provide implementation of AMQP methods. Some
others have additional features, convenience methods
and abstractions. Some of the clients are asynchronous
(non-blocking), some are synchronous (blocking), some support
both models. Some clients support vendor-specific extensions
(for example, RabbitMQ-specific extensions).

Because one of the main AMQP goals is interoperability, it is
a good idea for developers to understand protocol operations
and not limit themselves to terminology of a particular client
library. This way communicating with developers using different
libraries will be significantly easier.

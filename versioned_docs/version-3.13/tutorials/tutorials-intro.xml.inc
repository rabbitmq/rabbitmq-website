    RabbitMQ is a message broker: it accepts and forwards messages.

    You can think about it as a post office: when you put the mail that you want posting in a post box,
    you can be sure that the letter carrier will eventually deliver the mail to your recipient.

    In this analogy, RabbitMQ is a post box, a post office, and a letter carrier.

  <p>
    The major difference between RabbitMQ and the post office is that it doesn't deal with paper,
    instead it accepts, stores, and forwards binary blobs of data â€’ <em>messages</em>.

    RabbitMQ, and messaging in general, uses some jargon.

        <em>Producing</em> means nothing more than sending.
        A program that sends messages is a <em>producer</em> :

          <img src="../img/tutorials/producer.png" height="50" alt="A producer sends messages to a queue." />
          <div class="diagram_source">
            digraph {
              bgcolor=transparent;
              truecolor=true;
              rankdir=LR;
              node [style="filled"];
              //
              P1 [label="P", fillcolor="#00ffff"];
            }
          </div>
        </div-->

        <em>A queue</em> is the name for the post box in RabbitMQ.
        Although messages flow through RabbitMQ and your applications, they can only be stored inside a <em>queue</em>.
        A <em>queue</em> is only bound by the host's memory &amp; disk limits, it's essentially a large message buffer.
        Many <em>producers</em> can send messages that go to one queue, and many <em>consumers</em> can try to receive data from one <em>queue</em>.

        This is how we represent a queue:

        <!-- FIXME div class="diagram">
         <img src="../img/tutorials/queue.png" height="90" alt="A queue is the name for the post box in RabbitMQ." />
         <div class="diagram_source">
           digraph {
             bgcolor=transparent;
             truecolor=true;
             rankdir=LR;
             node [style="filled"];
             //
             subgraph cluster_Q1 {
               label="queue_name";
               color=transparent;
               Q1 [label="{||||}", fillcolor="red", shape="record"];
             };
           }
          </div-->
        </div>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Consuming</em> has a similar meaning to receiving.
        A <em>consumer</em> is a program that mostly waits to receive messages:

        <!-- FIXME div class="diagram">
          <img src="../img/tutorials/consumer.png" height="50" alt="A consumer receives messages." />
          <div class="diagram_source">
          digraph {
            bgcolor=transparent;
            truecolor=true;
            rankdir=LR;
            node [style="filled"];
            //
            C1 [label="C", fillcolor="#33ccff"];
          }
          </div>
        </div-->
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note that the producer, consumer, and broker do not have to reside on the same host; indeed in most applications they don't.
    An application can be both a producer and consumer, too.

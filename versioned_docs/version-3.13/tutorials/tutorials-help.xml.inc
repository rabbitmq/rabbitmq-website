    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
      This tutorial assumes RabbitMQ is <a href="../download.html">installed</a> and running
      on <code>localhost</code> on the <a href="../networking.html#ports">standard port</a> (<code>5672</code>). In case you use
      a different host, port or credentials, connections settings would require adjusting.
    </p>

# RabbitMQ OAuth 2.0 Auth Backend Examples

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

This tutorial-style guide has two primary goals:

1. Explore how applications and end users can [authenticate](./access-control) with RabbitMQ server using OAuth 2.0 protocol rather than
   the traditional username/password pairs or x.509 certificates.
2. Explore what it takes to set up RabbitMQ Server with OAuth 2.0 authentication mechanism.
   Additionally it explains how to stand up ([UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa)) as an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server and all the operations to create OAuth clients, users and obtain their tokens.

The guide covers several OAuth 2 usage scenarios in the context of RabbitMQ and is
accompanied by [a public GitHub repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-oauth2-tutorial).
The GitHub repository includes RabbitMQ and UAA configuration files, as well as Make targets
that make it easier to

## <a id="getting-started-with-uaa-and-rabbitmq" class="anchor" href="#getting-started-with-uaa-and-rabbitmq">Getting started with UAA and RabbitMQ</a>

Before proceeding with other more sophisticated examples, let's start RabbitMQ configured with OAuth 2.0 plugin and
[UAA](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/uaa.html) as the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server.

In the next section, you
will see how to set up UAA and RabbitMQ. If you are new to OAuth 2.0, it is a good starting point. If you already know OAuth 2.0
and you want to learn how to configure RabbitMQ to talk to one of OAuth 2.0 server tested on this tutorial, you can jump
straight to them. They are:

- [KeyCloak](./oauth2-examples-keycloak)
- [https://auth0.com/](./oauth2-examples-oauth0)
- [Azure Active Directory](./oauth2-examples-azure)
- [UAA](#uaa-asymmetrical-signing-keys)


#### <a id="uaa-asymmetrical-signing-keys" class="anchor" href="#uaa-asymmetrical-signing-keys">Use Asymmetrical Digital Singing Keys</a>

There are two ways to set up OAuth 2.0 in RabbitMQ. One uses symmetrical signing keys. And the other uses
asymmetrical signing keys. The Authorization server is who digitally signs the Access tokens and RabbitMQ
has to be configured to validate any of the two types of digital signatures.

Given that asymmetrical keys is the most widely used option, you are going to focus on how to
configure RabbitMQ with them.

Run the following 2 commands to get the environment ready to see Oauth 2.0 plugin in action:

  1. `make start-uaa` to get UAA server running
  2. `make start-rabbitmq` to start RabbitMQ server

The last command starts a RabbitMQ server with [specific configuration file](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-oauth2-tutorial/blob/main/conf/uaa/rabbitmq.config).

## <a id="access-management-ui" class="anchor" href="#access-management-ui">Access Management UI using OAuth 2.0 tokens</a>

The RabbitMQ Management UI can be configured with one of these two login modes:

* [Service-Provider initiated logon](#service-provider-initiated-logon): this is the default and traditional OAuth 2.0 logon mode.
  When the user visits the RabbitMQ Management UI, it shows a button with the label `Click here to logon`. When the user clicks it,
  the logon process starts by redirecting to the configured **Authorization Server**.
* [Identity-Provider initiated logon](#identity-provider-initiated-logon): this mode is opposite to the previous mode.
  The user must first access the RabbitMQ Management's `/login` endpoint with a token. If the token is valid, the user is allowed to access the RabbitMQ Management UI.
  This mode is very useful for Web sites which allow users to access the RabbitMQ Management UI with a single click.
  The original Web site get a token on user's behalf and redirects the user to the RabbitMQ Management's `/login` endpoint.

### <a id="service-provider-initiated-logon" class="anchor" href="#service-provider-initiated-logon">Service-Provider initiated logon</a>

The first time an end user arrives to the management UI, they are redirected to the configured OAuth 2.0 provider to authenticate.
Once they successfully authenticate, the user is redirected back to RabbitMQ
with a valid access token. RabbitMQ validates it and identify the user and its permissions from the token.

```plain
    [ UAA ] &lt;----2. auth----    [ RabbitMQ ]
            ----3. redirect-->  [  http    ]
                                  /|\
                                   |
                            1. rabbit_admin from a browser
```

At step 2, if this is the first time the user is accessing RabbitMQ resource, UAA will prompt the user to
authorize RabbitMQ application as shown on the screenshot below.

![authorize application](/img/oauth2/authorize-app.png)

UAA has previously been configured and seeded with two users:

* `rabbit_admin:rabbit_admin`
* and `rabbit_monitor:rabbit_monitor`

Now navigating to the [local node's management UI](http://localhost:15672) and login using any of those two users.

This is a token issued by UAA for the `rabbit_admin` user thru the redirect flow you just saw above.
It was signed with the symmetric key.

![JWT token](/img/oauth2/admin-token-signed-sym-key.png)

To configure the RabbitMQ Management UI with OAuth 2.0, the following configuration entries are required
in `advanced.config`:

```erlang
 ...
 {rabbitmq_management, [
    {oauth_enabled, true},
    {oauth_client_id, "rabbit_client_code"},
    {oauth_provider_url, "http://localhost:8080"},      
    ...
  ]},
```

### <a id="identity-provider-initiated-logon" class="anchor" href="#identity-provider-initiated-logon">Identity-Provider initiated logon</a>

Like Service-Provider initiated logon, with Idp-initiated logon users get to the RabbitMQ Management UI with a valid token.
The following scenarios are examples of Idp-initiated logon:

* RabbitMQ is behind a web portal which conveniently allow users to navigate directly to RabbitMQ fully authenticated.
* There is an OAuth2 proxy in between users and RabbitMQ which intercepts their requests and forwards them to RabbitMQ inserting the token into the HTTP `Authorization` header.  

The latter scenario is demonstrated [here](./oauth2-examples-proxy). The former scenario is covered in the following section.

#### Idp-initiated Logon using the Login Endpoint

A Web portal offers their authenticated users the option to navigate to RabbitMQ
by submitting a form with their OAuth token in the `access_token` form field as provided below:


```plain
    [ Idp | WebPortal ] ----&gt; 2. /login [access_token: TOKEN]----   [ RabbitMQ Cluster ]            
              /|\                                                        |       /|\
               |                                                         +--------+
      1. rabbit_admin from a browser                                   3. validate token        
```

If the access token is valid, RabbitMQ redirects the user to the **Overview** page.

By default, the RabbitMQ Management UI is configured with **service-provider initiated logon**, to configure **Identity-Provider initiated logon**,
add one entry to `advanced.config`. For example:

```erlang
 ...
 {rabbitmq_management, [
    {oauth_enabled, true},
    {oauth_provider_url, "http://localhost:8080"},      
    {oauth_initiated_logon_type, idp_initiated},
    ...
  ]},
```

**Important**: when the user logs out, or its RabbitMQ session expired, or the token expired, the user is directed to the
RabbitMQ Management landing page which has a **Click here to login** button.
The user is never automatically redirected back to the url configured in the `oauth_provider_url`.
It is only when the user clicks **Click here to login** , the user is redirected to the configured url in `oauth_provider_url`.

## <a id="access-other-protocols" class="anchor" href="#access-other-protocols">Access other protocols using OAuth 2.0 tokens</a>

The following subsections demonstrate how to use access tokens with any messaging protocol and also to access the management rest api.

### <a id="monitoring-agent-accessing-management-rest-api" class="anchor" href="#monitoring-agent-accessing-management-rest-api-2">Management REST api</a>

In this scenario a monitoring agent uses RabbitMQ HTTP API to collect monitoring information.
Because it is not an end user, or human, you refer to it as a *service account*.
This *service account* could be our `mgt_api_client` client you created in UAA with the `monitoring` *user tag*.

This *monitoring agent* would use the *client credentials* or *password* grant flow to authenticate (1) with
UAA and get back a JWT token (2). Once it gets the token, it sends (3) a HTTP request
to the RabbitMQ management endpoint passing the JWT token within the `Authorization` header as a *Bearer token*.

```plain
[ UAA ]                  [ RabbitMQ ]
  /|\                    [  http    ]
    |                          /|\
    |                       3.http://broker:15672/api/overview passing JWT token
    |                           |
    +-----1.auth---------  monitoring agent
    --------2.JWT--------&gt;
```

The following command launches the browser with `mgt_api_client` client with a JWT token previously obtained from UAA:

```bash
make curl-uaa url=http://localhost:15672/api/overview client_id=mgt_api_client secret=mgt_api_client
```


### <a id="amqp-protocol" class="anchor" href="#amqp-protocol">AMQP protocol</a>

An application connects to RabbitMQ using AMQP protocol and presents a JWT Token as a credential.
The application you are going to use is [PerfTest](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test) which is not an OAuth 2.0 aware application.
OAuth 2.0-aware application is covered in [scenario four](#scenario-4).

Instead you are launching the application with a token that you have previously obtained from UAA. This is just to probe AMQP access with a JWT Token. Needless to say that the application should instead obtain the JWT Token prior to connecting to RabbitMQ and it should also be able to refresh it before reconnecting. RabbitMQ validates the token before accepting it. If the token has expired, RabbitMQ will reject the connection.


First of all, an application which wants to connect to RabbitMQ using Oauth 2.0 must present a
valid JWT token. To obtain the token, the application must first authenticate (`1.`) with UAA. In case of a successful
authentication, it gets back a JWT token (`2.`) which uses it to connect (`3.`) to RabbitMQ.  


```plain
[ UAA ]                  [ RabbitMQ ]
  /|\                    [  amqp    ]
    |                          /|\
    |                       3.connect passing JWT
    |                           |
    +-----1.auth---------  amqp application
    --------2.JWT--------&gt;
```

You have previously configured UAA with these 2 OAuth 2.0 clients:

 * `consumer`
 * `producer`

In order to get a JWT token, an OAuth 2.0 client must be used.
Applications use the `Oauth client grant flow` to obtain a JWT token.

This the token issued by UAA for the `consumer` OAuth 2.0 client.

![JWT token](/img/oauth2/consumer-token-signed-with-sym-key.png)

To launch the consumer application invoke the following command:

```bash
make start-perftest-consumer
```

To see consumer logs:

```bash
docker logs consumer -f
```

To launch the producer application invoke the following command:

```bash
make start-perftest-producer
```

To inspect producer logs:

```bash
docker logs producer -f
```


To stop all the applications call the following command:

```bash
make stop-all-apps
```


### <a id="jms-protocol" class="anchor" href="#jms-protocol">JMS protocol</a>

In this use case you are demonstrating a basic JMS application which reads, via an environment variable (`TOKEN`),
the JWT token that will use as password when authenticating with RabbitMQ.

It is **critically important** to grant the required permission to the *exchange* `jms.durable.queues`.

Applications which send JMS messages require of these permissions:

* `rabbitmq.configure:*/jms.durable.queues`
* `rabbitmq.write:*/jms.durable.queues`
* `rabbitmq.read:*/jms.durable.queues`

Those permissions grant access on all virtual hosts.

Before testing a publisher and a subscriber application you need to build a local image for the
basic jms application by invoking this command:

```bash
make build-jms-client
```

To test a JMS application sending a message and authenticating via OAuth 2.0 run this command:

```bash
make start-jms-publisher
```

It sends a message to a queue called `q-test-queue`

Applications which subscribe to a JMS queue require of these permissions:

 * `rabbitmq.write:*/jms.durable.queues`

Those permissions grant access to all virtual hosts.

To test a JMS application subscribing to a queue and authenticating via OAuth 2.0 run this command:

```bash
make start-jms-subscriber
```

It subscribes to a queue called `q-test-queue`

### <a id="mqtt-protocol" class="anchor" href="#mqtt-protocol">MQTT protocol</a>

This scenario explores the use case where you authenticate with a JWT token to RabbitMQ MQTT port.

Note: in this example, RabbitMQ is already configured with the [`rabbitmq_mqtt` plugin](./mqtt).

This is no different than using AMQP or JMS protocols, all that matters is to pass an empty username and a JWT token as password.
However, **what it is really different** is how you encode the permissions. In this use case you are going to proceed as you did it in the previous use case where you handcrafted the JWT token rather than requesting it to UAA. Here is the the scopes required to publish
a message to a mqtt topic ([scopes-for-mqtt.json](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-oauth2-tutorial/blob/main/jwts/scopes-for-mqtt.json))

```javascript
{
  "scope": [
    "rabbitmq.write:*/*/*",
    "rabbitmq.configure:*/*/*",
    "rabbitmq.read:*/*/*"

  ],
  "extra_scope": "rabbitmq.tag:management",
  "aud": [
    "rabbitmq"
  ]
}
```

`rabbitmq.write:*/*/*` means allow write operation on a any vhost, on any exchange and any topic. In fact,
it is any "routing-key" because that is translated to a topic/queue.

You are going to publish a mqtt message by running the following command. If you have not run any of the
previous use cases, you need to launch rabbitmq first like this `make start-rabbitmq`.

```bash
make start-mqtt-publish TOKEN=$(bin/jwt_token scopes-for-mqtt.json legacy-token-key private.pem public.pem)
```

> IMPORTANT: If you try to access the Management UI and authenticate with UAA using rabbit_admin you
wont be able to do bind a queue with routing_key `test` to the `amq.topic` exchange because that user
in UAA does not have the required permissions. In our handcrafted token, you have granted ourselves the right permissions/scopes.

## <a id="advanced-configuration" class="anchor" href="#advanced-configuration">Use advanced OAuth 2.0 configuration</a>


### <a id="use-custom-scope-field" class="anchor" href="#use-custom-scope-field">Use a Custom Scope Field</a>

There are some Authorization servers which cannot include RabbitMQ scopes into the standard
JWT `scope` field. Instead, they can include RabbitMQ scopes in a custom JWT scope of their choice.

It is possible to configure RabbitMQ with a different field to look for scopes as shown below:

```erlang
[
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
    ...
    {extra_scopes_source, &lt;&lt;"extra_scope"&gt;&gt;},
    ...
    ]}
  ]},
].
```

To test this feature you are going to build a token, sign it and use it to hit one of the RabbitMQ management endpoints.
The command below allows us to hit any management endpoint, in this case it is the `overview`, with a token.

```bash
make curl-with-token URL=http://localhost:15672/api/overview TOKEN=$(bin/jwt_token scope-and-extra-scope.json legacy-token-key private.pem public.pem)
```


You use the python script `bin/jwt_token.py` to build the minimal JWT token possible that RabbitMQ is able to
validate which is:

```javascript
{
  "scope": [

  ],
  "extra_scope": [
    "rabbitmq.tag:management"
  ],
  "aud": [
    "rabbitmq"
  ]
}
```

### <a id="use-multiple-asymmetrical-signing-keys" class="anchor" href="#use-multiple-asymmetrical-signing-keys">Use multiple asymmetrical signing keys</a>

This scenario explores the use case where JWT tokens may be signed by different asymmetrical signing keys.

There are two ways to configure RabbitMQ with multiple signing keys:

 * **Statically** configure them via `rabbitmq.conf` as shown in the [plugin documentation page](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/main/deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2#variables-configurable-in-rabbitmqconf).
 * **Dynamically** add the keys to a running RabbitMQ node without having to restart it.
   This alternative is explained in more detail in the section [About rotating UAA signing key](#about-rotating-uaa-signing-key).
   This section will also use this option.

First you add a second signing key called `legacy-token-2-key` whose public key is `conf/public-2.pem`:

```bash
docker exec -it rabbitmq rabbitmqctl add_uaa_key legacy-token-2-key --pem-file=/conf/public-2.pem
Adding UAA signing key "legacy-token-2-key" filename: "/conf/public-2.pem"
```

And then you issue a token using the corresponding private key and use it to access the management endpoint `/api/overview`.

```bash
make curl-with-token URL=http://localhost:15672/api/overview TOKEN=$(bin/jwt_token scope-and-extra-scope.json legacy-token-2-key private-2.pem public-2.pem)
```

`bin/jwt_token` searches for private and public key files under the `conf` directory and jwt files under `jwts`.


### <a id="use-scope-aliases" class="anchor" href="#use-scope-aliases">Using Scope Aliases</a>

In this use case you are going to demonstrate how to configure RabbitMQ to handle
*custom scopes*. But what are *custom scopes*? They are any
scope whose format is not compliant with RabbitMQ format. For instance, `api://rabbitmq:Read.All`
is one of the custom scopes you will use in this use case.

#### How to configure RabbitMQ with custom scope mapping

Starting with [RabbitMQ `3.10.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.10.0),
the OAuth 2.0 plugin supports mapping of a scope aliases (arbitrary scope values or "names") to one or more scopes
in the format that follows the RabbitMQ OAuth 2.0 plugin conventions.

See below a sample RabbitMQ configuration where you map `api://rabbitmq:Read.All`
custom scope to `rabbitmq.read:*/*` RabbitMQ scope.

```erlang
{rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
 ...,
	{scope_aliases, #{
		&lt;&lt;"api://rabbitmq:Read.All"&gt;&gt;      => [&lt;&lt;"rabbitmq.read:*/*"&gt;&gt;],
	  ...
	},
	...
]}
```

Additionally, you can map a custom scope to many RabbitMQ scopes. For instance below you
are mapping the role `api://rabbitmq:producer` to 3 RabbitMQ scopes which grants
`read`, `write` and `configure` access on any resource and on any vhost:

```erlang
{rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
 ...,

	{scope_aliases, #{
		&lt;&lt;"api://rabbitmq:producer"&gt;&gt; => [
			&lt;&lt;"rabbitmq.read:*/*"&gt;&gt;,
			&lt;&lt;"rabbitmq.write:*/*"&gt;&gt;,
			&lt;&lt;"rabbitmq.configure:*/*"&gt;&gt;
		]
	}},
	...
]}
```

#### Scopes Aliases in JWT Tokens

If you do not configure RabbitMQ OAuth 2.0 plugin with `extra_scopes_source`, RabbitMQ
expects the `scope` token's field to carry *custom scopes*. For instance, below you have a sample JWT
token where the custom scopes are in the `scope` field :

```javascript
{
  "sub": "producer",
  "scope": [
    "api://rabbitmq:producer",
    "api://rabbitmq:Administrator"
  ],
  "aud": [
    "rabbitmq"
  ]
}
```

Now, let's say you do configure RabbitMQ OAuth 2.0 plugin with `extra_scopes_source` as shown below:

```erlang
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
    {resource_server_id, &lt;&lt;"rabbitmq"&gt;&gt;},
    {extra_scopes_source, &lt;&lt;"roles"&gt;&gt;},
    ...
```

With this configuration, RabbitMQ expects *custom scopes* in the field `roles` and
the `scope` field is ignored.

```javascript
{
  "sub": "rabbitmq-client-code",
  "roles": "api://rabbitmq:Administrator.All",
  "aud": [
    "rabbitmq"
  ]
}
```

#### UAA Configuration

To demonstrate this new capability you have configured UAA with two Oauth 2.0 clients. One
called `producer_with_roles` with the *custom scope* `api://rabbitmq:producer` and `consumer_with_roles` with
`api://rabbitmq:Read:All,api://rabbitmq:Configure:All,api://rabbitmq:Write:All`.
> You are granting configure and write permissions to the consumer because you have configured perf-test to declare
resources regardless whether it is a producer or consumer application.

These two uaac commands declare the two OAuth 2.0 clients above. You are adding an extra scope called `rabbitmq.*` so
that UAA populates the JWT claim `aud` with the value `rabbitmq`. RabbitMQ expects `aud` to match the value you
configure RabbitMQ with in the `resource_server_id` field.

```bash
uaac client add producer_with_roles --name producer_with_roles \
    --authorities "rabbitmq.*,api://rabbitmq:producer,api://rabbitmq:Administrator" \
    --authorized_grant_types client_credentials \
    --secret producer_with_roles_secret
uaac client add consumer_with_roles --name consumer_with_roles \
    --authorities "rabbitmq.* api://rabbitmq:read:All" \
    --authorized_grant_types client_credentials \
    --secret consumer_with_roles_secret
```


#### RabbitMQ Configuration

In the OAuth 2.0 tutorial repository, there are two RabbitMQ configuration files ready to be used, for UAA:

- [conf/uaa/rabbitmq-scope-aliases.config](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-oauth2-tutorial/blob/main/conf/uaa/rabbitmq-scope-aliases.config): configures a set of scope aliases.
- [conf/uaa/rabbitmq-scope-aliases-and-extra-scope.config](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-oauth2-tutorial/blob/main/conf/uaa/rabbitmq-scope-aliases-and-extra-scope.config): configures a `extra_scopes_source` and a set of scope aliases.


#### Demo 1: Launch RabbitMQ with custom scopes in scope field

To launch RabbitMq with scope mappings and with *custom scopes* in the `scope` field you run the following command:

```bash
CONFIG=rabbitmq-scope-aliases.config make start-rabbitmq
```

This command will stop RabbitMQ if it is already running.

Launch a producer application with the client `producer_with_roles`

```bash
make start-perftest-producer PRODUCER=producer_with_roles
```

To inspect the logs:

```bash
docker logs producer_with_roles -f
```

Launch a consumer application with the client `consumer_with_roles`

```bash
make start-perftest-consumer CONSUMER=consumer_with_roles
```

To check the logs : docker logs consumer_with_roles -f

Access management api with the client `producer_with_roles`

```bash
make curl url=http://localhost:15672/api/overview client_id=producer_with_roles secret=producer_with_roles_secret
```

To stop the perf-test applications run :

```bash
make stop-perftest-producer PRODUCER=producer_with_roles
make stop-perftest-consumer CONSUMER=consumer_with_roles
```

#### Demo 2: Launch RabbitMQ with custom scopes in extra scope field

To launch RabbitMq with scope mappings and with *custom scopes* in the `extra_scope` you run the following command:

```bash
CONFIG=rabbitmq-scope-aliases-and-extra-scope.config make start-rabbitmq
```

This command will stop RabbitMQ if it is already running

You cannot use UAA to issue the tokens because you cannot configure UAA to use a custom field for scopes.
Instead you are going to issue the token ourselves with the command `bin/jwt_token`.

Launch a producer application with the token [producer-role-in-scope.json](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-oauth2-tutorial/blob/main/jwts/producer-roles-in-extra-scope.json):

```bash
make start-perftest-producer-with-token PRODUCER=producer_with_roles TOKEN=$(bin/jwt_token producer-role-in-extra-scope.json legacy-token-key private.pem public.pem)
```

To inspect the logs:

```bash
docker logs producer_with_roles -f
```

Launch a consumer application with the token [consumer-roles-in-extra-scope.json](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-oauth2-tutorial/blob/main/jwts/consumer-roles-in-extra-scope.json):

```bash
make start-perftest-consumer-with-token CONSUMER=consumer_with_roles TOKEN=$(bin/jwt_token consumer-roles-in-extra-scope.json legacy-token-key private.pem public.pem)
```

Access management api with the token [producer-roles-in-extra-scope.json](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-oauth2-tutorial/blob/main/jwts/producer-roles-in-extra-scope.json)

```bash
make curl-with-token URL="http://localhost:15672/api/overview" TOKEN=$(bin/jwt_token producer-roles-in-extra-scope.json legacy-token-key private.pem public.pem)
```

To stop the `perf-test` applications, run:

```bash
make stop-perftest-producer PRODUCER=producer_with_roles
make stop-perftest-consumer CONSUMER=consumer_with_roles
```

### <a id="preferred-username-claims" class="anchor" href="#preferred-username-claims">Preferred username claims</a>

RabbitMQ needs to figure out the username associated to the token so that it can display it in the Management UI.
By default, RabbitMQ will first look for the `sub` claim and if it is not found it uses the `client_id`.

Most authorization servers return the user's GUID in the `sub` claim rather than the actual user's username or email address, anything the user can relate to. When the `sub` claim does not carry a *user-friendly username*, you can configure one or several claims to extract the username from the token.

Given this configuration:

```erlang
  ...
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
    {resource_server_id, &lt;&lt;"rabbitmq"&gt;&gt;},
    {preferred_username_claims, [&lt;&lt;"user_name"&gt;&gt; ,&lt;&lt;"email"&gt;&gt;]},
  ...
```

RabbitMQ would first look for the `user_name` claim and if it is not found it looks for `email`. Else it uses its default lookup mechanism which first looks for `sub` and then `client_id`.


### <a id="use-rar-tokens" class="anchor" href="#use-rar-tokens">Use Rich Authorization Request Tokens</a>

The [Rich Authorization Request](https://oauth.net/2/rich-authorization-requests/) extension provides a way for
OAuth 2.0 clients to request fine-grained permissions during an authorization request.
It moves away from the concept of scopes that are text labels and instead
defines a more sophisticated permission model.

RabbitMQ supports JWT tokens compliant with the extension. Below is a sample example section of JWT token:

```javascript
{
  "authorization_details": [
    { "type" : "rabbitmq",  
      "locations": ["cluster:finance/vhost:primary-*"],
      "actions": [ "read", "write", "configure"  ]
    },
    { "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance", "cluster:inventory", ],
      "actions": ["tag:administrator" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

*Get the environment ready*

To demonstrate this new capability you have to deploy RabbitMQ with the appropriate configuration file
under [conf/uaa/rabbitmq-for-rar-tokens.config](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-oauth2-tutorial/blob/main/conf/uaa/rabbitmq-for-rar-tokens.config).

```bash
export CONFIG=rabbitmq-for-rar-tokens.config
make start-rabbitmq
```

**NOTE**: You do not need to run any OAuth 2.0 server like UAA. This is because you are creating a token and signing it using the same
private-public key pair RabbitMQ is configured with.

*Use a Rich Authorization Token to access the management rest api*

You are going use this token [jwts/rar-token.json](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-oauth2-tutorial/blob/main/jwts/rar-token.json) to access an endpoint of the management rest api.

```bash
make curl-with-token URL=http://localhost:15672/api/overview TOKEN=$(bin/jwt_token rar-token.json legacy-token-key private.pem public.pem)
```

Note: You are using curl to go to the URL using a TOKEN which you have built using the command bin/jwt_token which takes the JWT payload, the name of the signing key and the private and public certificates to sign the token

*Use a Rich Authorization Token to access AMQP protocol*

This time, You are going to use the same token you used in the previous section to access the AMQP protocol via the PerfTest tool which acts as a AMQP producer application:

```bash
make start-perftest-producer-with-token PRODUCER=producer_with_roles TOKEN=$(bin/jwt_token rar-token.json legacy-token-key private.pem public.pem)
```

The command above launches the application in the background, you can check the logs by running this command:
```bash
docker logs producer_with_roles -f
```


For more information on this new capability check out the [OAuth 2 guide](./oauth2#rich-authorization-request).

### RabbitMQ Server

You need to launch RabbitMQ with the following prerequisites:

* Like with all other [plugins](./plugins), the OAuth 2.0 plugin must be enabled.
* Plugin is configured with the [same signing key as used by UAA](#about-signing-key-required-to-configure-rabbitmq)
* The node is configured to use OAuth 2.0 [authN and authZ backend](./access-control)
* [Management plugin](./management) is configured to use UAA

The following configuration snippets demonstrate these steps:

```erlang
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
    {resource_server_id, &lt;&lt;"rabbitmq"&gt;&gt;}
    {key_config, [
      {default_key, &lt;&lt;"legacy-token-key"&gt;&gt;},
      {signing_keys, #{
        &lt;&lt;"legacy-token-key"&gt;&gt; => {map, #{&lt;&lt;"kty"&gt;&gt; => &lt;&lt;"MAC"&gt;&gt;,
                                  &lt;&lt;"alg"&gt;&gt; => &lt;&lt;"HS256"&gt;&gt;,
                                  &lt;&lt;"use"&gt;&gt; => &lt;&lt;"sig"&gt;&gt;,
                                  &lt;&lt;"value"&gt;&gt; => &lt;&lt;"tokenKey"&gt;&gt;}}
      }}
    ]}
  ]},
```

```erlang
[
  % Instruct the node to use OAuth 2.0 backend first, then internal if necessary
  {rabbit, [
     {auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_oauth2, rabbit_auth_backend_internal]}
  ]},
].
```

```erlang
[
  {rabbitmq_management, [
    %% eanble Oauth
    {oauth_enabled,    true},
    %% use UAA
    {enable_uaa,    true},
    %% OAuth 2 identity server client ID
    {oauth_client_id, "rabbit_client"},
    %% UAA endpoint location
    {oauth_provider_url, "http://localhost:8080"}
  ]},
].
```

### UAA Server

Standalone OAuth 2.0 server (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa). Its primary role is as an OAuth 2.0 provider, issuing tokens for client applications to use when they act on behalf of Cloud Foundry users. It can also authenticate users with their Cloud Foundry credentials, and can act as an SSO service using those credentials. It has endpoints for managing user accounts and for registering OAuth 2.0 clients, as well as various other management functions

**Important note**: UAA can use an external database such PostgreSQL or MySQL.
For the demonstration purposes of this tutorial, the internal database is sufficient.

To verify that UAA is running and accessible on `localhost:8080`:

```bash
curl -k  -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/uaa/info | jq .
```

Currently RabbitMQ Management plugin does not support latest version of UAA. That is
why in order to run the use cases you use the image built from the folder `uaa-4.24`. This has to do
with the javascript library that comes with the management plugin.


### UAA client

In order to interact with UAA server there is a convenient command-line application called `uaac`. To install it and get it ready run the following command:

```bash
make install-uaac
```

In order to operate with uaa you need to "authenticate". There is an OAuth 2.0 client preconfigured with the following credentials `admin:adminsecret`.
This user is configured under `{uaa_repo}/uaa/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring/oauth-clients.xml`. The above command takes care of this.

### Clients, Users and Permissions in UAA

The Make target `make setup-users-and-clients` accomplishes a few things:

* Created `rabbit_client` client -in UAA- which is going to be used by RabbitMQ server to authenticate management users coming to the Management UI.
* Created `rabbit_admin` user -in UAA- which is going to be the full administrator user with full access.
* Created `rabbit_monitor` user -in UAA- which is going to be the monitoring user with just the *monitoring* *user tag*.
* Created `consumer` client -in UAA- which is going to be the RabbitMQ User for the consumer application.
* Created `producer` client -in UAA- which is going to be the RabbitMQ User for the producer application.
* Obtained tokens -from UAA- for the two end users and for the two clients.



## <a id="deeper-dive" class="anchor" href="#deeper-dive">Deeper Dive</a>

### About Users and Clients

First of all, you need to clarify the distinction between *users* and *clients*.
- A *user* is often represented as a live person. This is typically the user who wants to access the RabbitMQ Management UI/API.  
- A *client* (a.k.a. *service account*) is an application that acts on behalf of a user or act on its own. This is typically an AMQP application.

### About Permissions

*Users* and *clients* will both need to get granted permissions. In OAuth 2.0, permissions/roles are named *scopes*. They are free form strings. When a RabbitMQ user connects to RabbitMQ, it must provide a JWT token with those *scopes* as a password (and empty username). And RabbitMQ determines from those *scopes* what permissions it has.

The *scope* format recognized by RabbitMQ is as follows

```
{resource_server_id}.{permission}:{vhost_pattern}/{name_pattern}/{routing_key_pattern}
```

where:

- `{resource_server_id}` is a prefix used for *scopes* in UAA to avoid scope collisions (or unintended overlap)
- `{permission}` is an access permission (configure, read, write, tag)
- `{vhost_pattern}` is a wildcard pattern for vhosts token has access to
- `{name_pattern}` is a wildcard pattern for resource name
- `{routing_key_pattern}` is an optional wildcard pattern for routing key in topic authorization

For more information, see [how scopes are translated to RabbitMQ permissions](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2#scope-to-permission-translation)
and [RabbitMQ permissions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/./access-control#permissions) documentation.

Sample *scope*(s):

* `rabbitmq.read:*/*` grants `read` permission on any *vhost* and on any *resource*
* `rabbitmq.write:uaa_vhost/x-*` grants `write` permissions on `uaa_vhost` on any *resource* that starts with `x-`
* `rabbitmq.tag:monitoring` grants `monitoring` *user tag*

> Be aware that you have used `rabbitmq` resource_server_id in the sample scopes. RabbitMQ must be configured with this same `resource_server_id`. Check out [conf/symmetric_keys/rabbitmq.config](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-oauth2-tutorial/blob/main/conf/uaa-symmetrical/rabbitmq.config)


### About signing key required to configure RabbitMQ

This section is only to explain one of things you need to take care to configure RabbitMQ with OAuth 2.0 auth-backend. Do not run any of the commands explained on this section. They are all included in the `make` commands you will cover in the following sections.

To configure OAuth 2.0 plugin in RabbitMQ you need to obtain the JWT signing key used by UAA when it issues JWT tokens.
But our `admin` client does not have yet the right *authority* (`uaa.resource`) to get that signing key. You are going to "auto" grant it ourselves:

```bash
uaac client update admin --authorities "clients.read clients.secret clients.write uaa.admin clients.admin scim.write scim.read uaa.resource"
```

And now you retrieve the signing key:

```bash
uaac signing key -c admin -s adminsecret
```

which outputs:

```
kty: MAC
alg: HS256
value: tokenKey
use: sig
kid: legacy-token-key
```

Another way to retrieve it is via the UAA REST API:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/uaa/token_key' -i  -H 'Accept: application/json' -u admin:adminsecret
```


### About Rotating UAA signing key

When UAA rotates the signing key you need to reconfigure RabbitMQ with that key. You don't need to edit the configuration and restart RabbitMQ.

Instead, thru the `rabbitmqctl add_uaa_key` command you can add more keys. This is more or less what could happen.

1. UAA starts up with a signing key called "key-1"
2. You configure RabbitMQ with the signing key "key-1" following the procedure explained in the previous section
3. RabbitMQ starts
4. An application obtains a token from UAA signed with that "key-1" signing key and connects to RabbitMQ using the token
5. RabbitMQ can validate it because it has the signing key
6. UAA rotates the signing key. It has a new key "key-2"
7. An application obtains a new token from UAA. This time it is signed using "key-2". The application connect to RabbitMQ using the new token
8. RabbitMQ fails to validate it because it does not have "key-2" signing key. Later on you will see how RabbitMQ finds out the signing key name for the JWT
9. You add the new signing key via the `rabbitmqctl` command
10. This time RabbitMQ can validate tokens signed with "key-2"

One way to keep RabbitMQ up-to-date is to periodically check with [token keys endpoint](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/4.28.0/index.html#token-keys) (using the `E-tag` header). When the list of active tokens key has changed, you retrieve them and add them using `rabbitmqctl add_uaa_key`.

You are probably missing the ability to remove deprecated/obsolete signing keys.
The [function](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2/blob/master/src/uaa_jwt.erl) is there so you could potentially invoke it via `rabbitmqctl eval` command.


### Understanding Access tokens and how RabbitMQ uses it

First of all, lets quickly go thru how RabbitMQ uses the OAuth Access Tokens; how RabbitMQ users/clients pass the token; whats inside the token and what information in the token is relevant for RabbitMQ and how it uses it.

#### How Clients Pass JWT Tokens to RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ expects a [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) in the password field.

For end users, the best way to come to the Management UI is by the following url, replacing `{token}` with an actual encoded JWT.
This is how `make open` command is able to open the browser and login the user using a JWT.

```bash
http://localhost:15672/#/login/{token}
```

#### Signed Tokens

RabbitMQ expects a JWS, i.e. signed JWT. There are three parts to a signed token (JWS):

 * a header which describes the signing algorithm and the signing key identifier used to sign the JWT
 * a body with the actual token
 * a signature.

This is a example of the header of a JWT issued by UAA:

```javascript
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "jku": "https://localhost:8080/uaa/token_keys",
  "kid": "legacy-token-key",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

where:

  - [typ](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#page-8) is the media type which in this case is JWT. However the JWT protected header and JWT payload are secured using HMAC SHA-256 algorithm
  - [alg](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#page-10) is the signature algorithm
  - [jku](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#page-10) is the HTTP GET resource that returns the signing keys supported by the server that issued this token
  - [kid](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#page-11) identifies the signing key used to sign this token

Note that `uaac token decode` does not print the header only the actual token.
One simple way to get this information is via [jwt.io](https://jwt.io).

To get the signing key used by UAA you access the *token key* access point with the credentials of the `admin` UAA client; or a client which has the permission to get it.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/uaa/token_key \
 -H 'Accept: application/json' \
 -u admin:adminsecret  | jq .
```

It should print out:

```javascript
{
  "kty": "MAC",
  "alg": "HS256",
  "value": "tokenKey",
  "use": "sig",
  "kid": "legacy-token-key"
}
```

You can see that the `kid`s value above matches the `kid`'s in the JWT.

**Relevant token information for RabbitMQ**

Let's examine the following token which corresponds to end-user `rabbit_admin`.

```javascript
{
  "jti": "dfb5f6a0d8d54be1b960e5ffc996f7aa",
  "sub": "71bde130-7738-47b8-8c7d-ad98fbebce4a",
  "scope": [
    "rabbitmq.read:*/*",
    "rabbitmq.write:*/*",
    "rabbitmq.tag:administrator",
    "rabbitmq.configure:*/*"
  ],
  "client_id": "rabbit_client",
  "cid": "rabbit_client",
  "azp": "rabbit_client",
  "grant_type": "password",
  "user_id": "71bde130-7738-47b8-8c7d-ad98fbebce4a",
  "origin": "uaa",
  "user_name": "rabbit_admin",
  "email": "rabbit_admin@example.com",
  "auth_time": 1551957721,
  "rev_sig": "d5cf8503",
  "iat": 1551957721,
  "exp": 1552000921,
  "iss": "http://localhost:8080/uaa/oauth/token",
  "zid": "uaa",
  "aud": [
    "rabbitmq",
    "rabbit_client"
  ]
}
```

These are the fields relevant for RabbitMQ:
- `sub` ([Subject](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#page-9)) this is the identify of the subject of the token. **RabbitMQ uses this field to identify the user**. This token corresponds to the `rabbit_admin` end user. If you logged into the Management UI, you would see it in the top-right corner. If this were an AMPQ user, you would see it on each connection listed in the connections tab.  
  UAA would add 2 more fields relative to the *subject*: a `user_id` with the same value as the `sub` field, and `user_name` with user's name. In UAA, the `sub`/`user_id` fields contains the user identifier, which is a GUID.

- `client_id` (not part of the RFC-7662) identifies the OAuth client that obtained the JWT. You used `rabbit_client` client to obtain the JWT for `rabbit_admin` user. **RabbitMQ also [uses](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2/blob/master/src/rabbit_auth_backend_oauth2.erl#L169) this field to identify the user**.

- `aud` ([Audience](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#page-9)) this identifies the recipients and/or resource_server of the JWT. **RabbitMQ uses this field to validate the token**. When you configured RabbitMQ OAuth plugin, you set `resource_server_id` attribute with the value `rabbitmq`. The list of audience must have the `rabbitmq` otherwise RabbitMQ rejects the token.

- `jti` ([JWT ID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662#section-2.2)) this is just an identifier for the JWT

- `iss` ([Issuer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662#section-2.2)) identifies who issued the JWT. UAA will set it to end-point that returned the token.

- `scope` is an array of [OAuth Scope](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523#page-4). **This is what RabbitMQ uses to determine the user's permissions**. However, RabbitMQ will only use the *scopes* which belong to this RabbitMQ identified by the plugin configuration parameter `resource_server_id`. In other words, if the `resource_server_id` is `rabbitmq`, RabbitMQ will only use the *scopes* which start with `rabbimq.`.

- `exp` ([exp](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#page-9)) identifies the expiration time on
   or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. RabbitMQ uses this field to validate the token if it is present.
   > Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than
   a few minutes, to account for clock skew. However, RabbitMQ does not add any leeway.

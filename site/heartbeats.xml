    <title>Detecting Dead TCP Connections with Heartbeats and TCP Keepalives</title>
  </head>

      <doc:heading>Introduction</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Network can fail in many ways, sometimes pretty subtle
        (e.g. high ratio packet loss).  Disrupted TCP connections take
        a moderately long time (about 11 minutes with default
        configuration on Linux, for example) to be detected by the
        operating system. AMQP 0-9-1 offers a <i>heartbeat</i> feature
        to ensure that the application layer promptly finds out about
        disrupted connections (and also completely unresponsive
        peers). Heartbeats also defend against certain network
        equipment which may terminate "idle" TCP connections when
        there is no activity on them for a certain period of time.
      </p>

      <p>
        TCP keepalives is a TCP stack feature that serves a similar
        purpose and can be very useful (possibly in combination with heartbeats)
        but requires kernel tuning in order to be practical with most operating
        systems and distributions.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="heartbeats-timeout">
      <doc:heading>Heartbeat Timeout Value</doc:heading>
      <p>
        The <code>heartbeat timeout</code> value defines after what period of time
        the peer TCP connection should be considered unreachable (down) by RabbitMQ
        and client libraries. This value is negotiated between the
        client and RabbitMQ server at the time of connection. The
        client must be configured to request heartbeats.
      </p>
      <p>
        The broker and client will attempt to negotiate
        heartbeats by default. When both values are non-0, the lower of the requested
        values will be used. If one side uses a zero value (attempts to disable heartbeats)
        but the other does not, the non-zero value will be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The timeout is in seconds, and default value is <code>60</code>.
        Older releases used <code>580</code> seconds by default.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="heartbeats-interval">
      <doc:heading>Heartbeat Frames</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Heartbeat frames are sent about every <code>heartbeat timeout / 2</code>
        seconds. This value is sometimes referred to as the <code>heartbeat interval</code>.
        After two missed heartbeats, the peer is considered
        to be unreachable. Different clients manifest this differently
        but the TCP connection will be closed. When a client detects
        that RabbitMQ node is unreachable due to a heartbeat, it needs
        to re-connect.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to not confuse the timeout value with the interval one.
        RabbitMQ <a href="/configure.html">configuration</a> exposes the timeout value,
        so do the officially supported client libraries. However some clients might expose
        the interval, potentially causing confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any traffic (e.g. protocol operations, published messages, <a
        href="/confirms.html">acknowledgements</a>) counts for a valid
        heartbeat. Clients may choose to send heartbeat frames
        regardless of whether there was any other traffic on the
        connection but some only do it when necessary.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="disabling">
      <doc:heading>How to Disable Heartbeats</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Heartbeats can be disabled by setting the timeout interval to <code>0</code> on both client and server ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively a very high (say, 1800 seconds) value can be used on both ends to effectively disable heartbeats
        as frame delivery will be too infrequent to make a practical difference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neither practice is recommended unless <a href="#tcp-keepalives">TCP keepalives</a> are used
        instead with an adequately low inactivity detection period.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="using-heartbeats-in-java">
      <doc:heading>Enabling Heartbeats with Java Client</doc:heading>
      <p>
        To configure the heartbeat timeout in the Java client, set it with
        <code>ConnectionFactory#setRequestedHeartbeat</code> before
        creating a connection:
      </p>

<pre class="sourcecode java">
ConnectionFactory cf = new ConnectionFactory();

// set the heartbeat timeout to 60 seconds
cf.setRequestedHeartbeat(60);
</pre>

      <p>
        Note that in case RabbitMQ server has a non-zero heartbeat timeout
        configured (which is the default in versions starting with 3.6.x),
        the client can only lower the value but not increase it.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="using-heartbeats-in-dotnet">
      <doc:heading>Enabling Heartbeats with the .NET Client</doc:heading>
      <p>
        To configure the heartbeat timeout in the .NET client, set it with
        <code>ConnectionFactory.RequestedHeartbeat</code> before
        creating a connection:
      </p>

<pre class="sourcecode csharp">
var cf = new ConnectionFactory();

// set the heartbeat timeout to 60 seconds
cf.RequestedHeartbeat = 60;
</pre>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="false-positives">
      <doc:heading>Low Timeout Values and False Positives</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Setting heartbeat timeout value too low can lead to false
        positives (peer being considered unavailable while it is not
        really the case) due to transient network congestion,
        short-lived server flow control, and so on.

        This should be taken into consideration when picking a timeout
        value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several years worth of feedback from the users and client
        library maintainers suggest that values lower than 5 seconds
        are fairly likely to cause false positives, and values of 1
        second or lower are very likely to do so. Values within the 5
        to 20 seconds range are optimal for most environments.

      <p>
        <a href="/shovel.html">Shovel</a> and <a href="/federation.html">Federation</a> plugins open Erlang client

    <doc:section name="tcp-keepalives">
      <doc:heading>TCP Keepalives</doc:heading>
      <p>
        TCP contains a mechanism similar in purpose to the heartbeat
        (a.k.a. keepalive) one in messaging protocols and net tick
        timeout covered above: TCP keepalives. Due to inadequate
        defaults, TCP keepalives cannot be assumed to be suitable
        for messaging protocols. However, with proper tuning they can be
        useful as an additional defense mechanism in environments where
        applications cannot be expected to enable heartbeats or use
        reasonable values.
      </p>

      <p>
        In certain rare cases when heartbeats alone are not sufficient
        (e.g. when connections involved use a protocol that does
        not have a heartbeat mechanism of some kind), TCP keepalives must
        be configured to use a reasonably low timeout value.
      </p>

      <p>
        TCP keepalives cover all TCP connections on a host, both inbound
        and outgoing. This makes them useful in scenarios with a high outgoing
        connection churn, e.g. <a href="/shovel.html">Shovel</a> or <a href="/federation.html">Federation</a> plugin
        links that are often disabled and reenabled or interrupted.
      </p>

      <p>
        TCP keepalives an also be used instead of heartbeats by configuring them to lower system-specific
        values. In that case <a href="#disabling">heartbeats can be disabled</a>. The main benefit
        of this approach is that all TCP connections on a machine will use identical values
        regardless of the protocol and client library used.

    <doc:section name="tcp-proxies">
      <doc:heading>Heartbeats and TCP Proxies</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Certain networking tools (HAproxy, AWS ELB) and equipment
        (hardware load balancers) may terminate "idle" TCP
        connections when there is no activity on them for a certain
        period of time. Most of the time it is not desirable.
      </p>
      <p>
        When heartbeats are enabled on a connection, it results in
        periodic light network traffic. Therefore heartbeats have a side effect
        of guarding client connections that can go idle for periods of
        time against premature closure by proxies and load balancers.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a heartbeat timeout of 30 seconds the connection will produce periodic
        network traffic roughly every 15 seconds. Activity in the 5 to 15 second range
        is enough to satisfy the defaults of most popular proxies and load balancers.
        Also see the section on low timeouts and false positives above.

      <p>
        RabbitMQ nodes will <a href="/logging.html#connection-lifecycle-events">log connections</a> closed due to missed heartbeats. So will all
        officially supported client libraries. Inspecting server and client logs will provide
        valuable information and should be the first troubleshooting step.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be necessary to inspect the connections open to or from a node,
        their state, origin, username and effective heartbeat timeout value.

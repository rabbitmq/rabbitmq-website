    <title>Detecting Dead TCP Connections with Heartbeats</title>
  </head>

      <doc:heading>Introduction</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Network can fail in many ways, sometimes pretty subtle
        (e.g. high ratio packet loss).  Disrupted TCP connections take
        a moderately long time (about 11 minutes with default
        configuration on Linux, for example) to be detected by the
        operating system. AMQP 0-9-1 offers a <i>heartbeat</i> feature
        to ensure that the application layer promptly finds out about
        disrupted connections (and also completely unresponsive
        peers). Heartbeats also defend against certain network
        equipment which may terminate "idle" TCP connections when
        there's no activity on them for a certain period of time.

    <doc:section name="heartbeats-timeout">
      <doc:heading>Heartbeat Timeout Interval</doc:heading>
      <p>
        The heartbeat timeout value defines after what period of time
        the peer TCP connection should be considered unreachable (down) by RabbitMQ
        and client libraries. This value is negotiated between the
        client and RabbitMQ server at the time of connection. The
        client must be configured to request heartbeats. In RabbitMQ
        versions 3.0 and higher, the broker will attempt to negotiate
        heartbeats by default (although the client can still veto
        them). The timeout is in seconds, and default value is <code>60</code>
        (<code>580</code> prior to release 3.5.5).
      </p>
      <p>
        Heartbeat frames are sent about every <code>timeout / 2</code>
        seconds. After two missed heartbeats, the peer is considered
        to be unreachable. Different clients manifest this differently
        but the TCP connection will be closed. When a client detects
        that RabbitMQ node is unreachable due to a heartbeat, it needs
        to re-connect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any traffic (e.g. protocol operations, published messages, <a
        href="/confirms.html">acknowledgements</a>) counts for a valid
        heartbeat. Clients may choose to send heartbeat frames
        regardless of whether there was any other traffic on the
        connection but some only do it when necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heartbeats can be disabled by setting the timeout interval to <code>0</code>.
        This is not a recommended practice.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="using-heartbeats-in-java">
      <doc:heading>Enabling Heartbeats with Java Client</doc:heading>
      <p>
        To configure the heartbeat timeout in the Java client, set it with
        <code>ConnectionFactory#setRequestedHeartbeat</code> before
        creating a connection:
      </p>

<pre class="sourcecode java">
ConnectionFactory cf = new ConnectionFactory();

// set the heartbeat timeout to 60 seconds
cf.setRequestedHeartbeat(60);
</pre>

      <p>
        Note that in case RabbitMQ server has a non-zero heartbeat timeout
        configured (which is the default in versions starting with 3.6.x),
        the client can only lower the value but not increase it.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="using-heartbeats-in-dotnet">
      <doc:heading>Enabling Heartbeats with the .NET Client</doc:heading>
      <p>
        To configure the heartbeat timeout in the .NET client, set it with
        <code>ConnectionFactory.RequestedHeartbeat</code> before
        creating a connection:
      </p>

<pre class="sourcecode csharp">
var cf = new ConnectionFactory();

// set the heartbeat timeout to 60 seconds
cf.RequestedHeartbeat = 60;
</pre>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="false-positives">
      <doc:heading>Low Timeout Values and False Positives</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Setting heartbeat timeout value too low can lead to false
        positives (peer being considered unavailable while it really
        isn't the case) due to transient network congestion,
        short-lived server flow control, and so on.

        This should be taken into consideration when picking a timeout
        value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several years worth of feedback from the users and client
        library maintainers suggest that values lower than 5 seconds
        are fairly likely to cause false positives, and values of 1
        second or lower are very likely to do so. Values within the 5
        to 20 seconds range are optimal for most environments.

        Heartbeats in STOMP are opt-in. To enable them, use the <code>heart-beat</code>
        header when connecting. See <a href="https://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html#Heart-beating">STOMP specification</a> for an example.

      <doc:heading>Heartbeats and TCP Keepalives</doc:heading>
      <p>
        TCP contains a mechanism similar in purpose to the heartbeat
        (a.k.a. keepalive) one in messaging protocols and net tick
        timeout covered above: TCP keepalives. Due to inadequate
        defaults, TCP keepalives are not suitable, or even counterproductive,
        for messaging protocols. However, with proper tuning they can be
        useful as an additional defense mechanism in environments where
        applications cannot be expected to enable heartbeats or use
        reasonable values. See the <a href="/networking.html">Networking guide</a> for details.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="tcp-proxies">
      <doc:heading>Heartbeats and TCP Proxies</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Certain networking tools (HAproxy, AWS ELB) and equipment
        (hardware load balancers) which may terminate "idle" TCP
        connections when there's no activity on them for a certain
        period of time. Most of the time it is not desirable.
      </p>
      <p>
        When heartbeats are enabled on a connection, it results in
        periodic light network traffic. Therefore heartbeats have a side effect
        of guarding client connections that can go idle for periods of
        time against premature closure by proxies and load balancers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heartbeat timeouts from 10 to 30 seconds will produce periodic
        network traffic often enough (roughly every 5 to 15 seconds))
        to satisfy defaults of most proxy tools and load balancers.
        Also see the section on low timeouts and false positives above.

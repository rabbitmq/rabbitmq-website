    <title>AMQP 0-9-1 Protocol Specification</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      AMQP 0-9-1 is a binary messaging protocol and <a href="./tutorials/amqp-concepts.html">semantic framework</a>
      for microservices and enterprise messaging.
    </p>

    <h2 id="amqp1.0">AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0</h2>
    <p>
      Despite similar names and, to some extent, a common lineage, AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0
      are completely different messaging protocols and not a revision of the same idea.
      AMQP 1.0 has a different scope and topology model. RabbitMQ supports AMQP 0-9-1, AMQP 1.0,
      MQTT and STOMP. See <a href="./documentation.html">documentation ToC</a> for details.

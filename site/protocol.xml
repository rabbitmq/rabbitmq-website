      AMQP is a standard wire-level protocol and semantic framework
      for high performance enterprise messaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the AMQP website:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        AMQP is an Open Standard for Messaging Middleware.
      </p>
      <p>
        By complying to the AMQP standard, middleware products
        written for different platforms and in different
        languages can send messages to one another. AMQP
        addresses the problem of transporting value-bearing
        messages across and between organisations in a timely
        manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        AMQP enables complete interoperability for messaging
        middleware; both the networking protocol and the
        semantics of broker services are defined in AMQP.
      </p>

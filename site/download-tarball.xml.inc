        <p>
          Contained in the tarball is a directory named
          <code>rabbitmq_server-&version-server;</code>. This directory is the node base directory. It should be
          moved to a suitable application directory on the system, such as <code>/usr/local</code>.
          The <code>sbin</code> directory in that directory contains server and <a href="/cli.html">CLI tool</a> scripts.
          It is a good candidate for including into <code>PATH</code>.
        </p>

      <p>
        Any plugins that do not ship with the server will need to be
        installed as .ez archives by copying them to the plugins
        directory. Once they have been copied to the correct
        directory, they will show up in
        <code>rabbitmq-plugins list</code> and can be enabled with
        <code>rabbitmq-plugins enable <i>plugin-name</i></code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The plugins directory location is determined by the
        <b>RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_DIR</b> variable.  Its default value
        depends on how you installed RabbitMQ. Some common values are:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Installation method</th><th>Plugins directory</th></tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Debian/RPM packages</th>
          <td>
            <code>/usr/lib/rabbitmq/lib/rabbitmq_server-</code><i>version</i><code>/plugins</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Windows</th>
          <td>
            Typically
              <code>C:\Program Files\RabbitMQ\rabbitmq_server-</code><i>version</i><code>\plugins</code>
            (depending on where it was installed)
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Homebrew</th>
          <td>
            <code>/usr/local/Cellar/rabbitmq/</code><i>version</i><code>/plugins</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Generic&#160;Unix</th>
          <td>
            <code>rabbitmq_server-</code><i>version</i><code>/plugins</code>
            (depending on where it was installed)
          </td>
        </tr>

        <p>
          The enabled plugins configuration is preserved between
          upgrades, so there is no need to re-enable plugins after an
          upgrade, but because the plugins directory changes between
          versions, any third party plugins will need to be copied to
          the new directory. It's very possible that due to API
          changes you may need to check for updates to third party
          plugins at this point.

        <p>
          You can also build RabbitMQ plugins from source.  The sources for a
          particular version of the plugins is distributed in the same
          archive as the broker with that version.  The source code
          repositories can all be found on <a
          href="https://github.com/rabbitmq">GitHub</a>. See the
          <a href="plugin-development.html">plugin development</a>
          guide for more information on building plugins from source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that plugins tend to be strongly bound to a particular
          version of <code>rabbitmq-server</code>. For example, if you are
          running RabbitMQ &version-server;, you should check out all plugins
          with the Git tag <code>&version-server-tag;</code>.

       <p class="intro">
         This guide covers RabbitMQ release packages signing and how to verify the signatures on
         downloaded release artifacts.
       </p>
       <p>
         Release signing allows users to verify that the artifacts they have downloaded
         were published by a trusted party (such as a team or package distribution
         service). This can be done using GPG command line tools. Package management tools such as <code>apt</code> and <code>yum</code>
         also verify repository signatures.

      <doc:heading>Signing Keys</doc:heading>
      <p>
        RabbitMQ release artifacts, both binary and source,
        are signed using <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/signing-keys/releases/download/2.0/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc">our release signing key</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Services that distribute packages can do signing on behalf of the publisher. <a href="#package-cloud">Package Cloud</a> is one such
        service used by RabbitMQ. Users who provision packages from Package Cloud must import the Package Cloud-provided signing keys
        instead of those used by the RabbitMQ team.

      <doc:subsection name="importing-gpg">
        <doc:heading>With GPG</doc:heading>
        <p>
          Before signatures can be verified, RabbitMQ <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/signing-keys/releases/download/2.0/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc">signing key</a>
          must be downloaded. This can be done using the <a href="https://sks-keyservers.net/overview-of-pools.php">SKS keyservers pool</a>:

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
gpg --keyserver hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x6B73A36E6026DFCA
</pre>
        </p>

        <p>
   	  Alternatively the key can be downloaded directly from <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/signing-keys/releases/">GitHub</a>
          or <a href="https://dl.bintray.com/rabbitmq/Keys/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc">Bintray</a>
          or <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc">rabbitmq.com</a>:

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
curl -L https://github.com/rabbitmq/signing-keys/releases/download/2.0/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc --output rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc
gpg --import rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc
</pre>
        </p>
      </doc:subsection>

      <doc:subsection name="importing-apt">
        <doc:heading>With apt</doc:heading>
        <p>
          On Debian and Ubuntu systems, assuming that <a href="/install-debian.html">apt repositories</a> are used for installation,
          <code>apt-key</code> should be used to import the keys:

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
apt-key adv --keyserver hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x6B73A36E6026DFCA
</pre>
        </p>
      </doc:subsection>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="checking-signatures">
      <doc:heading>Verifying Signatures</doc:heading>
      <p>
        To check signatures for the packages, download the RabbitMQ signing key
        and a signature file. Signature files use the <code>.asc</code> extension that follows their artifact filename,
        e.g. the signature file of <code>rabbitmq-server-generic-unix-3.7.8.tar.xz</code> would be <code>rabbitmq-server-generic-unix-3.7.8.tar.xz.asc</code>.

        Then use <code>gpg --verify</code>:

<pre class="sourcecode bash">gpg --verify [filename].asc [filename]</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      	Here's an example session, after having retrieved a RabbitMQ
      	source archive and its associated detached signature from
      	the download area:

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
gpg --verify rabbitmq-server_3.7.8-1_all.deb.asc rabbitmq-server_3.7.8-1_all.deb
gpg: Signature made Thu Sep 20 16:32:33 2018 BST
gpg:                using RSA key 6B73A36E6026DFCA
gpg: using subkey 0xEDF4AE3B59B046FA instead of primary key 0x6B73A36E6026DFCA
gpg: using PGP trust model
gpg: Good signature from "RabbitMQ Signing Key &lt;info@rabbitmq.com&gt;" [full]
Primary key fingerprint: 4E30 C634 2FB4 AF5C 6334  2330 79A1 D640 D80A 61F0
     Subkey fingerprint: 5EC4 26E8 A6F3 523D D924  8FC8 EDF4 AE3B 59B0 46FA
gpg: binary signature, digest algorithm SHA512
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the signature is invalid, a "BAD signature"
        message will be emitted. If that's the case the origin of the package,
        the signature file and the signing key should be carefully verified.
        Packages that fail signature verification must not be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the signature is valid, you should expect a "Good
        signature" message; if you've not signed our key, you will
        see a "Good signature" message along with a warning about
        our key being untrusted.
      </p>
      <p>
	If you trust the RabbitMQ signing key you avoid the warning output by
	GnuPG by signing it using your own key (to create your private key run <code>gpg --gen-key</code>):

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
gpg --sign-key 0x6B73A36E6026DFCA
</pre>
      </p>

    <doc:section name="package-cloud">
      <doc:heading>Package Cloud</doc:heading>
      <p>
        <a href="https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq">Package Cloud</a> is a hosted package distribution
        service that uses their own signing keys to sign the artifacts uploaded to it. The key(s) then
        must be imported with GPG, <code>apt-key</code> and similar tools. Package Cloud provides repository
        setup script that include signing key import.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of late 2018 Package Cloud is undergoing a signing key migration. Instead of relying on a "master key",
        projects will migrate to use repository-specific signing keys. Before the migration is completed,
        both old and new key must be imported for forward compatibility.
      </p>
      <p>
<pre class="sourcecode bash">
# import the new PackageCloud key that will be used starting December 1st, 2018 (GMT)
curl -L https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/gpgkey \
  -O packagecloud-rabbitmq-key.asc -s
gpg --import packagecloud-rabbitmq-gpg-key.asc

# import the old PackageCloud key that will be discontinued on December 1st, 2018 (GMT)
curl -L https://packagecloud.io/gpg.key \
  -O packagecloud-legacy-key.asc -s
gpg --import packagecloud-legacy-key.asc
</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        After importing both keys please follow the <a href="https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq">Package Cloud</a> repository
        setup instructions.

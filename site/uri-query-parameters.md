# URI Query Parameters

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

This page is a less-formal companion to the <a
href="uri-spec.html">URI specification</a>, documenting how the
officially-supported clients interpret URI parameters. Currently
only the Erlang client does so.

The [Federation](federation-reference.html#upstreams)
and [Shovel](shovel.html#uris) plugins specify
connections to other brokers using URIs, and are implemented
using the Erlang client, so they take all the parameters
described here for it.

## <a id="basics" class="anchor" href="#basics">The Basics</a>

Query parameters are added to the URI in the usual way. Any
parameter can be omitted. The client will pick sensible defaults
when they are.

Example (non-encrypted):

<pre class="lang-ini">
amqp://myhost?heartbeat=5&amp;connection_timeout=10000
</pre>

This specifies a (non-encrypted) network connection to the host
`myhost`. The heartbeat interval is set to 5 seconds,
and connection timeout is set to 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds).
Other parameters are set to their default values.

Example (encrypted):

<pre class="lang-ini">
amqps://myhost?cacertfile=/path/to/ca_certificate.pem
  &amp;certfile=/path/to/client_certificate.pem
  &amp;keyfile=/path/to/client_key.pem
  &amp;verify=verify_peer
  &amp;server_name_indication=myhost
</pre>

## <a id="tls" class="anchor" href="#tls">TLS Parameters</a>

This specifies an encrypted network connection to the host
`myhost`. Absolute paths to the certificate files
are provided. `verify_peer` ensures that certificate
chain of trust is verified, and `server_name_indication`
validates the `CN` value in the server's certificate
against the hostname `myhost`.

      Only of use for the <code>amqps</code> scheme and used to
      configure verification of the server's x509 (TLS)
      certificate. <b>Note:</b> It is highly recommended to use
      both values. See the <a href="ssl.html">TLS guide</a> to
      learn more about TLS support in RabbitMQ in general and specifically the
      <a href="ssl.html#configure-erlang">Erlang client</a>
      section.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>auth_mechanism</code></td>
    <td>
      SASL authentication mechanisms to consider when negotiating
      a mechanism with the server. This parameter can be specified
      multiple times,
      e.g. <code>?auth_mechanism=plain&amp;auth_mechanism=amqplain</code>,
      to specify multiple mechanisms.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>heartbeat</code></td>
    <td>
      <a href="/heartbeats.html">Heartbeat</a> timeout value in seconds (an integer)
      to negotiate with the server.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>connection_timeout</code></td>
    <td>
      Time in milliseconds (an integer) to wait while establishing a TCP connection
      to the server before giving up.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>channel_max</code></td>
    <td>
      Maximum number of channels to permit on this connection.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

[TLS options](/ssl.html) can also be specified globally using the
`amqp_client.ssl_options` configuration key in the `rabbitmq.config` or
`advanced.config` file in this manner:

<pre class="lang-erlang">
{amqp_client, [
    {ssl_options, [
        {cacertfile, "path-to-ca-certificate"},
        {certfile, "path-to-certificate"},
        {keyfile, "path-to-keyfile"},
        {verify, verify_peer},
        {fail_if_no_peer_cert, true}
    ]}
]}
</pre>

They will be merged with the TLS parameters from the URI (the latter will take
precedence) and affect all outgoing RabbitMQ Erlang client connections on the
node, including plugins that use the client internally (Federation, Shovel,
etc). Please see the [TLS guide](/ssl.html) for details.

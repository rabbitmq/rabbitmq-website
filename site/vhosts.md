# Virtual Hosts NOSYNTAX

## Introduction

RabbitMQ is multi-tenant system: connections, exchanges, queues, bindings, user permissions,
policies and some other things belong to **virtual hosts**, logical groups of
entities. If you are familiar with [virtual hosts in Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/)
or [server blocks in Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/server_blocks/), the idea is similar.
There is, however, one important difference: virtual hosts in Apache are defined
in the configuration file; that's not the case with RabbitMQ: virtual hosts are
[created](#creating) and [deleted](#deleting) using `rabbitmqctl` or HTTP API instead.

## <a id="logical-separation" class="anchor" href="#logical-separation">Logical and Physical Separation</a>

Virtual hosts provide logical grouping and separation of
resources. Separation of physical resources is not a goal of virtual
hosts and should be considered an implementation detail.

For example, [resource permissions](/access-control.html) in RabbitMQ are
scoped per virtual host. A user doesn't have global permissions, only
permissions in one or more virtual hosts. User tags can be considered
global permissions but they are an exception to the rule.

Therefore when talking about user permissions it is very important
to clarify what virtual host(s) they apply to.

## <a id="client-connections" class="anchor" href="#client-connections">Virtual Hosts and Client Connections</a>

A virtual host has a name. When an AMQP 0-9-1 client connects to
RabbitMQ, it specifies a vhost name to connect to. If authentication
succeeds and the username provided was [granted permissions](/access-control.html) to the
vhost, connection is established.

Connections to a vhost can only operate on exchanges, queues, bindings, and so on in
that vhost. "Interconnection" of e.g. a queue and an exchange in different vhosts is only possible
when an application connects to two vhosts at the same time. For example, an
application can consume from one vhost then republishes into the other. This scenario
can involve vhosts in different clusters or the same cluster (or a single node).
[RabbitMQ Shovel plugin](/shovel.html) is one example of such application.


## <a id="creating" class="anchor" href="#creating">Creating a Virtual Hosts</a>

A virtual host can be created using CLI tools or an [HTTP API](/management.html) endpoint.

A newly created vhost will have a default set of [exchanges](/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html)
but no other entities and no [user permissions](/access-control.html). For a user to be able to connect
and use the virtual host, permissions to it must be [granted]() to every user that will use the vhost,
e.g. using [rabbitmqctl set_permissions](/rabbitmqctl.8.html#set_permissions).

### Using CLI Tools

A virtual host can be created using [rabbitmqctl](/cli.html)'s `add_vhost` command
which accepts virtual host name as the only mandatory argument.

Here's an example that creates a virtual host named `qa1`:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl add_vhost qa1
</pre>

### Using HTTP API

A virtual host can be created using the `PUT /api/vhosts/{name}` [HTTP API](/management.html) endpoint
where `{name}` is the name of the virtual host

Here's an example that uses [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) to create a virtual host `vh1` by contacting
a node at `rabbitmq.local:15672`:

<pre class="lang-bash">
curl -u userename:pa$sw0rD -X PUT http://rabbitmq.local:15672/api/vhosts/vh1
</pre>


### <a id="preprovisioning" class="anchor" href="#preprovisioning">Bulk Creation and Pre-provisioning</a>

Virtual host creation involves a blocking cluster-wide transaction. Each node has to perform
a number of setup steps which are moderately expensive. In practice it can take up to a few seconds
for a virtual host to be created.

When a number of virtual hosts is created in a loop, CLI and HTTP API clients can outpace the actual
rate of virtual host creation and experience timeouts. If that's the case operation timeout should be increased
and delays should be introduced between operations.

Definition [export](/backup.html) and [import](/management.html#load-definitions) is the recommended
way of pre-configuring many virtual hosts at deployment time.


## <a id="deleting" class="anchor" href="#deleting">Deleting a Virtual Hosts</a>

A virtual host can be created using CLI tools or an [HTTP API](/management.html) endpoint.

Deleting a virtual host will permanently delete all entities (queues, exchanges, bindings, policies, permissions, etc) in it.

### Using CLI Tools

A virtual host can be deleted using [rabbitmqctl](/cli.html)'s `delete_vhost` command
which accepts virtual host name as the only mandatory argument.

Here's an example that deletes a virtual host named `qa1`:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl delete_vhost qa1
</pre>

### Using HTTP API

A virtual host can be created using the `DELETE /api/vhosts/{name}` [HTTP API](/management.html) endpoint
where `{name}` is the name of the virtual host

Here's an example that uses [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) to delete a virtual host `vh1` by contacting
a node at `rabbitmq.local:15672`:

<pre class="lang-bash">
curl -u userename:pa$sw0rD -X DELETE http://rabbitmq.local:15672/api/vhosts/vh1
</pre>


## Virtual Hosts and STOMP

Like AMQP 0-9-1, STOMP includes the [concept of virtual hosts](https://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html#CONNECT_or_STOMP_Frame). See
the [STOMP guide](/stomp.html) for details.


## Virtual Hosts and MQTT

Unlike AMQP 0-9-1 and STOMP, MQTT doesn't have the concept of virtual
hosts. MQTT connections use a single RabbitMQ host by default. There
are MQTT-specific convention and features that make it possible for
clients to connect to a specific vhosts without any client library
modifications. See the [MQTT guide](/mqtt.html) for details.


## <a id="limits" class="anchor" href="#limits">Limits</a>

In some cases it is desirable to limit the maximum allowed number of queues
or concurrent client connections in a vhost. As of RabbitMQ 3.7.0,
this is possible via **per-vhost limits**.

These limits can be configured using `rabbitmqctl` or [HTTP API](/management.html).

### Configuring Limits Using rabbitmqctl

`rabbitmqctl set_vhost_limits` is the command used to define vhost limits.
It requires a vhost parameter and a JSON document of limit definitions.

### Configuring Max Connection Limit

To limit the total number of concurrent client connections in vhost
`vhost_name`, use the following limit definition:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl set_vhost_limits -p vhost_name '{"max-connections": 256}'
</pre>

To disable client connections to a vhost, set the limit to a zero:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl set_vhost_limits -p vhost_name '{"max-connections": 0}'
</pre>

To lift the limit, set it to a negative value:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl set_vhost_limits -p vhost_name '{"max-connections": -1}'
</pre>

### Configuring Max Number of Queues

To limit the total number of queues in vhost
`vhost_name`, use the following limit definition:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl set_vhost_limits -p vhost_name '{"max-queues": 1024}'
</pre>

To lift the limit, set it to a negative value:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl set_vhost_limits -p vhost_name '{"max-queues": -1}'
</pre>

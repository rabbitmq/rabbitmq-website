  <p>
    RabbitMQ installations running production workloads may need system
    limits and kernel parameters tuning in order to handle a decent number of
    concurrent connections and queues. The main setting that needs adjustment
    is the max number of open files, also known as <code>ulimit -n</code>.
    The default value on many operating systems is too low for a messaging
    broker (eg. 1024 on several Linux distributions). We recommend allowing
    for at least 65536 file descriptors for user <code>rabbitmq</code> in
    production environments. 4096 should be sufficient for most development
    workloads.

    <title>The Homebrew RabbitMQ Formula</title>

      <doc:heading>Overview</doc:heading>

      <p>
        <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is a popular package manager for MacOS.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/rabbitmq.rb">RabbitMQ formula</a> is available from
        <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>'s core tap (out of the box).
        The formula will also install a reasonably recent <a href="/which-erlang.html">supported Erlang/OTP version</a>
        as a dependency.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="installation">
      <doc:heading>Installation</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Before installing make sure the taps are up-to-date:

<pre class="sourcecode shell">
brew update
</pre>

        Then, install RabbitMQ server with:

<pre class="sourcecode shell">
brew install rabbitmq
</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        Installing the RabbitMQ formula will install key dependencies such
        as a <a href="/which-erlang.html">supported Erlang/OTP version</a>.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="operations">
      <doc:heading>Operations</doc:heading>

      <p>
        The RabbitMQ server scripts and <a href="/cli.html">CLI tools</a> are installed under <code>/usr/local/sbin</code>.
        In case that directory is not in <code>PATH</code> it's recommend to append
        it:

<pre class="sourcecode shell">
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin
</pre>

        The server can then be started with <code>rabbitmq-server</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Homebrew the node and CLI tools will use the logged in user account by default. Using <code>sudo</code>
        is not required.
      </p>

      <p>
        Otherwise operations are no different from the generic binary build.
        Please refer to the <a href="install-generic-unix.html#operations">Operations section</a> of
        the generic binary build guide section.

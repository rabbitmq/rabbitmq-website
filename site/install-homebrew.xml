    <title>Installing on Homebrew</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is a popular package manager for MacOS.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/rabbitmq.rb">RabbitMQ formula</a> is available from
      <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>'s core tap (out of the box).
      The formula will also install a reasonably recent Erlang/OTP version
      as a dependency.
    </p>
    <h3>Install the Server</h3>
    <p>
      Before installing make sure you have the latest brews:
      <pre>brew update</pre>
      Then, install RabbitMQ server with:
      <pre>brew install rabbitmq</pre>
    </p>
    <h3>Run RabbitMQ Server</h3>
    <p>
      The RabbitMQ server scripts are installed into <code>/usr/local/sbin</code>.
      This is not automatically added to your path, so you may wish to add<br />
      <code>PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin</code> to your <code>.bash_profile</code>
      or <code>.profile</code>.
      The server can then be started with <code>rabbitmq-server</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All scripts run under your own user account. Sudo is not required.
    </p>

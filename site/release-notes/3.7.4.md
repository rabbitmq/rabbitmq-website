   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1535](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1535)

 * Queue master locator strategy of `min-masters` was affected by queue binding count and could
   select the wrong node.

 * It was not possible to set [randomized startup delay](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html#initial-formation-race-condition) range via new style config file.

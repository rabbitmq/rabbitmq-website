Upgrading
=========
To upgrade a non-clustered RabbitMQ from release 2.1.1 or later, simply
install the new version. All configuration and persistent message data
is retained.

To upgrade a clustered RabbitMQ from release 2.1.1 or later, install
the new version on all the nodes and follow these instructions:
    http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#upgrading
All configuration and persistent message data is retained.

To upgrade a non-clustered RabbitMQ from release 2.1.0, first upgrade
to 2.1.1 (which retains all data), and then to the current version as
described above.

To upgrade a clustered RabbitMQ prior to 2.1.1 or a stand-alone broker
from releases prior to 2.1.0, if the RabbitMQ installation does not
contain any important data then simply install the new
version. RabbitMQ will move the existing data to a backup location
before creating a fresh, empty database. A warning is recorded in the
logs. If your RabbitMQ installation contains important data then we
recommend you contact support@rabbitmq.com for assistance with the
upgrade.

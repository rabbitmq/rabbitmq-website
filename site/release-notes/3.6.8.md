## RabbitMQ 3.6.8

RabbitMQ `3.6.8` is a maintenance release that restores Erlang/OTP R16B03 and 17.x compatibility
that was unintentionally affected in [3.6.7](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/rabbitmq_v3_6_7) by producing that release on a significantly newer Erlang/OTP version.

### Upgrades and Compatibility

See the ["Upgrading clusters" section of the documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#upgrading) for general documentation on upgrades.

This release has no incompatibilities with 3.6.7. See [3.6.7 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/rabbitmq_v3_6_7) upgrade and compatibility nodes if upgrading from an earlier release.

### Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Erlang/OTP R16B03 and 17.x are supported again by producing this release on R16B03.
   Note that [some configurations or community plugins](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) may require a later version.
   We recommend all users to upgrade to a 19.x series release if possible. See [Debian](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html) and [RPM installation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html) guides for some Erlang/OTP installation options.

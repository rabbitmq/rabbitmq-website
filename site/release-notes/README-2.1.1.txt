Upgrading
=========
The database schema has not changed since version 2.1.0, so user accounts,
durable exchanges and queues, and persistent messages will all be retained
during the upgrade.

If, however, you are upgrading from a release prior to 2.1.0, when the
RabbitMQ server detects the presence of an old database, it moves it to a
backup location, creates a fresh, empty database, and logs a warning. If
your RabbitMQ installation contains important data then we recommend you
contact support@rabbitmq.com for assistance with the upgrade.

## RabbitMQ 3.7.7

RabbitMQ `3.7.7` a maintenance release. This release introduces
compatibility with [Erlang/OTP 21](https://www.erlang.org/news/123).

### Upgrades and Compatibility

This release has no known incompatibilities with earlier `3.7.x` releases.

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.0

When upgrading to this release **and upgrading Erlang to 21.0** at the same time, extra care has to be taken.
Since CLI tools from any earlier RabbitMQ release will fail on Erlang 21, RabbitMQ **must be upgraded before Erlang**.

#### Documentation Guides and Change Log

See [3.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.7.0) upgrade and
compatibility notes if upgrading from an earlier release.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades and
[RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

### Consul Peer Discovery Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

  * The following combination of settings was rejected by the plugin, even though they are reasonable
    and were recommended by the docs:
    
    ``` ini
    cluster_formation.consul.svc_addr_auto = true
    # en0 is just an example, it could be any other NIC name
    cluster_formation.consul.svc_addr_nic = en0
    ```

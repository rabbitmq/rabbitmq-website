## RabbitMQ 3.6.3

RabbitMQ `3.6.3` is a maintenance release that includes
bug fixes, packaging and build system enhancements.

As of `3.6.3`, RabbitMQ also comes with several additional plugins in the distribution:

 * [rabbitmq_top](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-top), which helps identify (Erlang) processes
   that consume most RAM and CPU resources

 * [rabbitmq_trust_store](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-trust-store) which manages
   trusted client x509/TLS certificates

 * [rabbitmq_jms_topic_exchange](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jms-topic-exchange/) which, together with [RabbitMQ JMS Java client](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jms-client), provides support for the JMS 1.1 API
   atop RabbitMQ.

### Breaking Changes

 * Debian package now [supports systemd and also drops support for some older distributions](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rabbitmq-users/orFuEYExcxk).

 * All artifacts in this release are signed with a [new 4096-bit OpenGPG key](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rabbitmq-users/BO5cmEsdEhc/Jupz1_Q4AwAJ).

### Known Issues on Erlang 19.0

An undocumented runtime metric change in Erlang 19.0 [breaks management plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/244).

### Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * (Newly elected) queue master process could terminate immediately after promotion

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#812](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/812)

 * Priority queue mirror could fail to synchronize after restart
 
   GitHub issues: [rabbitmq-server#687](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/687), [rabbitmq-server#802](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/802)

 * Shutdown timeouts for worker processes are now much more reasonable.
   Earlier the timeouts were virtually infinite which could lead to a deadlock during node shutdown.

 * Purging of a durable queue could result in undelivered publisher confirms.

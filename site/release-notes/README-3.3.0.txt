==================

server
------
bug fixes
26069 ensure that memory use is bounded when logging crash of large
      processes (since 1.0.0)
25589 ensure that a queue which needs to reduce its RAM usage but is not
      receiving any publishes still pages out messages quickly (since 2.0.0)
25991 fix topic routing in the face of multiple bindings that differ only
      in arguments (e.g. those created by the federation plugin) (since 2.4.0)
26027 ensure autoheal does not hang winner node if 'rabbitmqctl stop_app'
      issued on other node during healing (since 3.1.0)
26043 ensure autoheal does not crash if multiple autoheal requests occur
      in quick succession and the leader make different decisions for each
      (since 3.1.0)
26088 fix failure to delete virtual host if a queue in the virtual host is
      deleted concurrently (since 1.0.0) (incorrectly reported fixed in 3.2.4)

enhancements
25888 give busy queues a bias towards delivering more messages than they

      are being held back by low prefetch counts

      friendly

      (see http://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-prefetch.html)
25827,25853 substantially improve performance stopping and starting brokers
      with many durable queues

24408 improve performance of mandatory publication (very substantially when
      publishing across clusters)
25939,25942,25943 improve performance reading and writing AMQP (especially
      reading large messages)

Upgrading
=========
To upgrade a non-clustered RabbitMQ from release 2.1.1 or later, simply install
the new version. All configuration and persistent message data is retained.

To upgrade a clustered RabbitMQ from release 2.1.1 or later, install the new
version on all the nodes and follow the instructions at
http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#upgrading .

To upgrade RabbitMQ from release 2.1.0, first upgrade to 2.1.1 (all data will be
retained), and then to the current version as described above.

When upgrading from RabbitMQ versions prior to 2.1.0, the existing data will be
moved to a backup location and a fresh, empty database will be created. A
warning is recorded in the logs. If your RabbitMQ installation contains
important data then we recommend you contact support at rabbitmq.com for
assistance with the upgrade.

Release: RabbitMQ 1.5.0
Status : beta

Release Highlights
==================

server
------
bug fixes
- support running on top of the latest Erlang/OTP release (R12B-5)
- maintain effect visibility guarantees in cross-node routing
- reduce likelihood of timeouts when channels interact with a large
  number of queues
- graceful handling of some corner cases in abrupt client disconnect

enhancements
- remove tickets and realms
- improve scalability of queue and binding creation and deletion
- add 'queue.unbind' command to protocol
- disable Nagle for more consistent latency
- throttle producers with 'channel.flow' when running low on memory
  Note that this feature is disabled by default; please see
  http://www.rabbitmq.com/admin-guide.html#memsup for details.
- remove a few spurious errors in the logs
- show the actual listening IP & port in logs
- improve rabbitmqctl:
  - add a few useful info commands
  - add a 'reopen_logs' command to assist in log management
  - add a '-q' flag to suppress informational messages and thus
    facilitate post-processing of the output
  - write errors to stderr instead of stdout

Java client
-----------
bug fixes
- eliminate several race condition in connection and channel closure
  that could result in deadlock
- always respond to a server's 'connection.close' and 'channel.close'
- prevent interference between interal locking on channels and
  application-level locking

enhancements
- remove tickets and realms
- support 'queue.unbind'
- disable Nagle for more consistent latency
- react to server-issued 'channel.flow' by (un)blocking producers
- add channel.abort method to unconditionally and idempotently close a
  channel
- complete the set of channel and connection close and abort methods

.net client
-----------
bug fixes
- eliminate "Cannot access a disposed object" exception in connection
  closure and disposal
- correct heartbeat logic to prevent spurious timeouts when not idling

enhancements
- remove tickets and realms
- support 'queue.unbind'
- disable Nagle for more consistent latency
- react to server-issued 'channel.flow' by (un)blocking producers
- add IModel.abort method to unconditionally and idempotently close a
  channel
- complete the set of channel and connection close and abort methods

building & packaging
--------------------
bug fixes
- correct locations of libraries et al on 64bit rpm systems

enhancements
- detect upgrade from pre-1.5.0 and warn/ask user (under debian & rpm)
- comply with debian and rpm packaging policies and guidelines
- prevent accidental executing of scripts as non-root user under
  debian & rpm
- read /etc/default/rabbitmq in scripts on Unix-y systems, with env
  vars taking precedence over vars set in that file and the defaults
  used by the scripts
- prefix env vars with 'RABBITMQ_'
- allow script execution from anywhere (not just the scripts' dir)
- add script & instructions to start RabbitMQ as a Windows service
- add 'status' command to init.d script under debian & rpm
- automatic log rotation under debian & rpm
- use simplejson.py instead of json.py in code generation, thus
  allowing use of Python 2.6


Upgrading
=========

The database schema has changed between RabbitMQ-1.4.0 and this
release. When the RabbitMQ server detects the presence of an old
database, it moves it to a backup location, creates a fresh, empty
database, and logs a warning.

If your RabbitMQ installation contains important data, such as user
accounts, durable exchanges and queues, or persistent messages, then
we recommend you contact support@rabbitmq.com for assistance with the
upgrade.

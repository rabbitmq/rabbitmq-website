## RabbitMQ 3.7.8

RabbitMQ `3.7.8` a maintenance release. It focuses on bug fixes and
further improves [Erlang/OTP 21](https://www.erlang.org/news/123) compatibility.

### Compatibility Notes

This release has no known incompatibilities with earlier `3.7.x` releases.

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.0

When upgrading to this release **and upgrading Erlang to 21.0** at the same time, extra care has to be taken.
Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21, RabbitMQ **must be upgraded before Erlang**.

#### Documentation Guides and Change Log

See [3.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.7.0) upgrade and
compatibility notes if upgrading from an earlier release.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades and
[RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.


## Changes

### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Virtual host (specifically binding) recovery has been optimized.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1650](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1650)

 * A binding removal optimization was reverted because it could result in custom exchange type state not cleaned up
   as plugin authors intended.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1691](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1691)

 * A queue sync operation now can be cancelled when a resource alarm is in effect on the receiving node.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1636](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1636)

 * Inter-node communication port (a.k.a. distribution port) unintentionally used an excessively large
   buffer size (1.2 GB instead of 128 MB). Kudos to Chris Friesen for noticing and reporting this.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1659](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1659)

 * More idempotent binding removal.

   When transactions that removed bindings were rolled back and retried, the code
   that performed the deletion could fail with a misleading assertion failure, `{error, not_found}`.   

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1689](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1689)

 * A resource alarm triggered during boot could prevent node from starting.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1644](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1644)

 * Environments with high queue or channel churn could run into an exception in local process group.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1699](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1699)

 * Priority queues no longer fail with an exception when used together with other `rabbit_backing_queue`
   behaviour implementations.

   Contributed by Matteo Cafasso.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1669](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1669)

 * Syslog configuration parameters could be rejected by config validator.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1639](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1639)

 * `rabbitmq-echopid.bat` now loads `rabbitmq-env.bat` correctly.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1642](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1642)

#### Enhancements

 * Improved config file validation and loading. For example, `advanced.config` now can be used
   without the main `rabbitmq.conf` config file.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1671](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1671)

 * On Erlang/OTP 21 Syslog server now can be configured using a hostname (not just an IP address).

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1658](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1658)

 * `rabbitmqctl rename_cluster_node` documentation improvements.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1641](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1641)


### CLI Tools

#### Bug Fixes

 * Policies were unintentionally excluded from `rabbitmqctl report` output.

   Contributed by Ayanda Dube.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#256](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/pull/256)

 * Global parameters were unintentionally excluded from `rabbitmqctl report` output.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#258](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/pull/258)


### Management Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Virtual host imported from definitions or created via HTTP API will explicitly await for the vhost to initialise
   on all cluster nodes. This change was previously scheduled for `3.7.6` but was only partially applied (didn't have any effect on HTTP API clients).

   GitHub issues: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#575](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/575), [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#591](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/591)

 * HTTP API connection endpoints returned a duplicate key, `node`.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#601](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/601)

 * Response compression wasn't enabled by default for compatible clients.
 
 * Failed login error message now clears automatically after successful login.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#609](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/609)

#### Enhancements

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#593](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/593)

 * Switching sections will now scroll to the top of the newly rendered page.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#590](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/590)

### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Memory usage monitor uses subprocesses a lot more sparingly. They are started
   roughly once a second or not started at all, depending on the strategy (e.g. on Windows
   Erlang VM allocator information is used instead).
   
   GitHub issues: [rabbitmq-server#1343](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1343), [rabbitmq-common#224](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common/issues/224)

 * Very busy queues are now more efficient at prioritizing consumers, avoiding
   consumer delivery blocking when relatively long running operations (e.g. bulk flushing
   of transient messages to disk) happen.
   
   GitHub issues: [rabbitmq-server#1388](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1388), [rabbitmq-server#1407](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1407)

 * Queue master strategies now take additional queue HA arguments into account.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1371](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1371)

 * Logging to standard output using `RABBITMQ_LOGS=-` wasn't possible on Windows.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1348](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1348)

 * Queue master locator name now can be specified as Erlang strings.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1411](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1411)

 * Direct Erlang client connections could fail with obscure messages when
   target node was still booting.
   
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1356](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1356)

#### Enhancements

 * `supervisor2` now can be used in environments that perform hot code upgrades.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-common#230](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common/pull/230)

 * systemd service file now white lists exit code 69.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server-release#51](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server-release/issues/51)

 * Example systemd service file now includes service restart settings.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1359](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1359)

 * Queue master locator strategy now can be configured using strings.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1411](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1411)

 * Plugin activation avoids logs things that can be confusing.

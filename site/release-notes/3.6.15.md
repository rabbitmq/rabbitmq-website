### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

* Avoid infinite loop when dropping entries in the GM.

    GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1431](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1431)

* Various changes to the OCF scripts.

    Github issues: [rabbitmq-server-release#66](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server-release/pull/66),
    [rabbitmq-server-release#67](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server-release/pull/67),
    [rabbitmq-server-release#73](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server-release/pull/73)

#### Enhancements

 * [Internal authN backend](https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html) will now prohibit logins with a blank passwords. Such attempts
   are usually made by mistake because a passwordless user that was meant to authenticate
   using [x509 (TLS) certificates](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-mechanism-ssl/) was not configured to use the correct [authentication
   mechanism](https://www.rabbitmq.com/authentication.html).

   Note that the same behavior can already be achieved using a [credential validator](https://www.rabbitmq.com/passwords.html), 
   so this is just an extra safety measure.

   Github issue: [rabbitmq-server#1466](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1466)
   

### Management Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

* Multi-input forms (such as message properties) again submit all fields.

    GitHub issues: [rabbitmq-management#511](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/511)

 * User update form now successfully updates tags for passwordless users (or if the password is cleared at the same time).
  
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-management#533](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/533)

* `Content-Type` header was returned twice in API responses.

    GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-management#527](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/527)

* Avoid duplicated event handlers in the UI.

    Github issue: [rabbitmq-management#516](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/516)

* Use `auto` width to make option values fully visible.

    Github issue: [rabbitmq-management#519](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/519)

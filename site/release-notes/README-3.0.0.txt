Release: RabbitMQ 3.0.0

server
------
bug fixes
25195 prevent slave being promoted before it has received all
      messages from dying master, which subsequently caused it to crash
25202 fix race at slave startup causing process leak and other problems
25216 prevent excessive memory use when recovering large durable queues
25226 prevent slaves leaking memory when using persistence and confirms
25260 ensure messages that expire while the broker is stopped are
      dead-lettered correctly
25198, 25185, 25200 ensure "redelivered" flag set correctly on HA
      queue failover
25053 ensure statistics event emission does not prevent fsync
25215 ensure rapid declaration of many mirrored queues does not overload
      Mnesia
25000 don't write a PID file when -detached is specified as it will
      not be right
25263 fix channel number in error message if rabbit_writer crashes
25295, 25297 fix a couple of small memory leaks in rabbit_channel when
      one channel sees many queues deleted

enhancements
24991 correctly enforce AMQP frame_max. Note that some buggy clients
      do not frame messages correctly; as of 3.0.0 these clients
      will be rejected if they attempt to send a message large than
      frame_max (by default 128k).
24908 allow queue mirroring to be defined by broker-wide policy, not
      queue declaration, and add "exactly" mode
24196 dynamic runtime configuration mechanism (parameters)
24914 rewrite of rabbitmqctl clustering commands for greater user
      friendliness
24915 background GC for idle processes, preventing excessive memory use
19376 support per-message TTL
25110 provide more detailed statistics on broker memory use (reported
      in 'rabbitmqctl status')
25227 provide information if a network partition has occurred
      (reported in 'rabbitmqctl cluster_status')
24792 improve plugin startup procedure:
      - "rabbitmqctl wait" will not return until plugins have started
      - Windows service users no longer need to reinstall service
        after enabling plugins
24971 enable heartbeats by default
24719 ensure broker starts and rabbitmq-plugins works when plugin
      dependencies are missing
25164 give better error message when attempting to use a queue which
      is on a down node
25086 improve error reporting for framing errors
25262 sort the output of rabbitmqctl list_*
23935 reverse DNS lookups for connection info items (disabled by
      default, see the 'reverse_dns_lookup' configuration item)
25193 expose count of non-blocked consumers as a queue info item
24998 make memory / disk alarms easier to spot in log files
24956 provide better log messages when heartbeat timeouts occur
24919 check flags passed to rabbitmqctl match the subcommand
25244 cope if clients set malformed "x-death" headers
24867 reject attempts to declare queues with x-expires or
      x-message-ttl greater than 2^32 milliseconds since this will
      not work

23896 remove support for AMQP's "immediate" publish mode

performance improvements

25220 allow bindings with arguments containing AMQP tables and arrays
23225 correctly display network traffic statistics for connections
      which do nothing but receive autoack messages

      loaded broker
25148 clearer error message when the management port is in use at startup
24967 web UI help texts link to the website for more information

Upgrading
=========
To upgrade a non-clustered RabbitMQ from release 2.1.1 or later, simply install
the new version. All configuration and persistent message data is retained.

To upgrade a clustered RabbitMQ from release 2.1.1 or later, install the new
version on all the nodes and follow the instructions at
http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#upgrading .

To upgrade RabbitMQ from release 2.1.0, first upgrade to 2.1.1 (all data will be
retained), and then to the current version as described above.

When upgrading from RabbitMQ versions prior to 2.1.0, the existing data will be
moved to a backup location and a fresh, empty database will be created. A
warning is recorded in the logs. If your RabbitMQ installation contains
important data then we recommend you contact support at rabbitmq.com for
assistance with the upgrade.

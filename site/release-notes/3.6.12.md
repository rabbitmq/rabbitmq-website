### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Process responsible for running the autoheal partition handling strategy
   could run into a deadlock with its peers, preventing autoheal from completing.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1346](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1346)

 * Garbage collection of mirrored queue metrics on nodes that did not
   host a master or mirror for a queue affected delivery and acknowledgement rates.
   This could result in rates being 0 or negative when they should not be.
   
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1340](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1340)

 * Stats emission could prevent queue mirrors from performing garbage collection
   and consume memory even when they were empty.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-common#220](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common/pull/220) (continuation to [rabbitmq-common#196](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common/issues/196))

 * `RABBITMQ_SCHEDULER_BIND_TYPE` and `RABBITMQ_DISTRIBUTION_BUFFER_SIZE` now can be set via `rabbitmq-env.conf`.

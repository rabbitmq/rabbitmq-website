## RabbitMQ 3.6.7

RabbitMQ `3.6.7` is a maintenance release that includes a [new reworked management plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/236) that stores collected stats on all cluster nodes (as opposed to one dedicated node).

### Upgrades and Compatibility

See the ["Upgrading clusters" section of the documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#upgrading) and a note at the end of this release notes document for general documentation on upgrades.

#### ⚠️ Erlang/OTP R16B03 and 17.x Compatibility

Erlang/OTP R16B03 users on Debian and Ubuntu may run into [runtime code compilation errors](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rabbitmq-users/XfQgta5v6Z0).
While this [was addressed in 3.6.8](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/rabbitmq_v3_6_8), we recommend upgrading to at least Erlang 18.0 if possible
(see [Debian installation guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html) and [RPM installation guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html)).

#### ⚠️ New Management Plugin

In clusters that have rabbitmq_management or rabbitmq_management_agent plugins enabled all nodes must be upgraded at the same time.

There is a couple of public-facing changes in the HTTP API.

##### Test Suites that use HTTP API

Integration test suites that rely on HTTP API for listing
or closing connections, channels, etc need to be adjusted with this plugin:

 * We recommend reducing stats retention periods (see [Hop](https://github.com/rabbitmq/hop/blob/master/bin/before_build.sh#L11), [rabbit-hole](https://github.com/michaelklishin/rabbit-hole/blob/master/bin/ci/before_build.sh))
 * Because stats emission is now two-step and asynchronous, test suites may need
   to wait for events to propagate before asserting on them (see [Hop](https://github.com/rabbitmq/hop/blob/master/src/test/groovy/com/rabbitmq/http/client/ClientSpec.groovy#L168), [rabbit-hole](https://github.com/michaelklishin/rabbit-hole/blob/master/rabbithole_test.go#L130)).

##### POST and PUT Responses Use `201 Created`

POST and PUT responses now use `201 Created` instead of `204 No Content`.


#### ⚠️ Single Atom TCP Listener Options

Single atom TCP listener options such as `binary` in this example:

``` erlang
[
 {rabbit, [
           {tcp_listen_options, [
                                 binary,
                                 {backlog, 4096},
                                 {sndbuf, 32768},
                                 {recbuf, 32768}
                                ]}
  %% …
  }].
```

won't serialise to JSON correctly in this release. This is [addressed for 3.6.8](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management-agent/issues/34).
Note that `binary` is one of the default options and there is no need to override it.

There are no other known incompatibilities with 3.6.2 or later releases.

### Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Queue master process could terminate with a `{bad_match, {error, not_found}}` error.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1035](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1035)

 * `rabbitmq-service.bat` should exit with a non-0 code when installation fails.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1052](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1052)

 * `rabbitmqctl stop_app` now produces a more technically correct output about
   what the operation does.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1043](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1043)

#### Enhancements

 * Nodes in a cluster now can be restared in arbitrary order. They will attempt to contact
   one of the previously seen peers periodically (10 times with 30 second intervals by default).
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1033](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1033) 

 * Increased credit flow default settings, background GC is disabled by default
   for more predictable latency.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1098](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1098)

   a larger number of virtual hosts with the new management plugin.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1059](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1059)

 * `RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_DIR` now supports multiple directories (colon-separated on Linux and other UNIX-like
   platforms, semicolon-separated on Windows).

### Top Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Internal buffer length of processes that implement the `gen_server2` behaviour
   (most notably queues) are now collected and visible in `rabbitmq_top`. Combined
   with Erlang mailbox length this provides a more or less complete picture of Erlang
   message backlog a process has.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-top#20](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-top/issues/20)


### Event Exchange Plugin

#### Enhacements

 * Resource alarm events are now accessible via the event exchange.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#1120](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1120)

#### Bug Fixes

 * When HTTP basic authentication is used but credentials are not provided, the plugin should
   fall back to default configured STOMP plugin credentials.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-web-stomp#60](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-stomp/issues/60)

#### Enhancements

 * Web STOMP port is now registered as a TCP listener and shows up in the management UI
   listeners section.
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-web-stomp#65](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-stomp/issues/65)


### Trust Store Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Pluggable certificate providers (sources).
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-trust-store#1](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-trust-store/issues/1)
 
 * HTTP(S) certificate provider (source).
 
   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-trust-store#54](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-trust-store/issues/54)


### .NET Client

#### Bug Fixes

 * `AutorecoveringConnection` had unsynchronised concurrent access to several of its mutable field.
 
   GitHub issues: [rabbitmq-dotnet-client#288](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/288),
                  [rabbitmq-dotnet-client#291](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/291)


### Erlang Client

#### Bug Fixes

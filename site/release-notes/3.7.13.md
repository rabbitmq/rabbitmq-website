## RabbitMQ 3.7.13-beta.1

RabbitMQ `3.7.13-beta.1` is a preview of a maintenance release. It focuses on bug fixes and
minor usability improvements. This release [**requires Erlang/OTP 20.3**](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

Per the new Erlang version support policy in effect starting with January 2019,
this release [**no longer supports Erlang/OTP 19.3**](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rabbitmq-users/G4UJ9zbIYHs/qCeyjkjyCQAJ).
Make sure a [supported Erlang version](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) is used before upgrading.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories)
explains what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of
Erlang `20.3.x` and `21.x`.

### Compatibility Notes

#### Minimum Required Erlang Version

This release requires Erlang/OTP 20.3 or later.

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x

When upgrading to this release **and upgrading Erlang to 21.x** at the same time, extra care has to be taken.
Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21,
RabbitMQ **must be upgraded before Erlang**.

#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See [3.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.7.0) upgrade and
compatibility notes if upgrading from an earlier release.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades and

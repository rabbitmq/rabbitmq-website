Upgrading
=========

If you are upgrading from an earlier release of RabbitMQ, note that
RabbitMQ's internal database schema has changed, and hence the
MNESIA_BASE directory should be cleared before starting the new
server. This wipes out any configuration information and persisted
messages.

The upgrade process will be much improved in future releases, to the
point where a running RabbitMQ cluster can be upgraded without service
interruption. Meanwhile, if you need assistance in migration please
contact the RabbitMQ team at support@rabbitmq.com.

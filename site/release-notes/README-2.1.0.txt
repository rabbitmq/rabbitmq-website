Upgrading
=========
The database schema has changed since the last release (2.0.0). When
starting, the RabbitMQ server will detect the existence of an old
database and will move it to a backup location, before creating a
fresh, empty database, and will log a warning. If your RabbitMQ
installation contains important data then we recommend you contact
support@rabbitmq.com for assistance with the upgrade.

## RabbitMQ 3.8.3-beta.3

RabbitMQ `3.8.3-beta.3` is a preview of a maintenance release.

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [**requires Erlang/OTP 21.3**](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.
`22.x` series is recommended.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `21.3.x` and `22.x`.

### Compatibility Notes

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x or Later Versions

When upgrading to this release from `3.7.6` or an older version, extra care has to be taken.

Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21 or later,
RabbitMQ **must be upgraded at the same time as Erlang**. Alternatively the node can be upgraded
to `3.7.18` first, then Erlang 21.x or 22.x, then to RabbitMQ 3.8.x.

#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See [3.8.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0) upgrade
and compatibility notes first if upgrading from an earlier release.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades
and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

## Changes

### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Autoheal could fail to finish if one of its state transitions initiated by a remote node timed out.

   Contributed by @tomyouyou.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2209](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2209)

 * Reduced scheduled GC activity in connection socket writer to one run per 1 GiB of data transferred,
   with an option to change the value or disable scheduled run entirely. More frequent binary heap GC runs seem
   unneccesary on Erlang 22.

   Contributed by Aleksander Nycz.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common#343](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common/pull/343)

 * The node now can recover even if virtual host recovery terms file was corrupted.

   Contributed by @tomyouyou.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2195](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2195)

 * If a quorum queue leader rebalancing operation timed out, CLI tools failed with an exception
   instead of a sensible internal API response.

   Contributed by Gabriele Santomaggio.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2214](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2214)

 * Syslog client is now started even when Syslog logging is configured only for some log sinks.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2044](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2044)

#### Enhancements

 * RabbitMQ nodes will now gracefully shutdown when receiving a `SIGTERM` or `SIGQUIT` signals.
   Previously the runtime would invoke a default handler that terminates the VM giving
   RabbitMQ no chance to execute its shutdown steps.

   In addition, `SIGUSER1` and `SIGUSR2` signals are ignored.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2222](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2222)

 * Quorum queue deletion operation no longer supports the "if unused" and "if empty" options.
   They are typically used for transient queues don't make much sense for quorum ones.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2211](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2211)

 * Every cluster now features a persistent internal cluster ID that can be used by core features
   or plugins. Unlike the human-readable cluster name, the value cannot be overriden by the user.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2226](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2226)

 * Some proxy protocol errors are now logged at debug level. This reduces log noise in environments
   where TCP load balancers and proxies perform health checks by opening a TCP connection but never sending
   any data.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2204](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2204)


### CLI Tools

#### Bug Fixes

 * `rabbitmq-diagnostics status` failed to display the results when executed against a node
   that had high VM watermark set as an absolute value (using `vm_memory_high_watermark.absolute`).

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#395](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/395)

#### Enhancements

 * New health checks that can be used to determine if it's a good moment to shut down a node for an upgrade.

   ``` sh
   # Exits with a non-zero code if target node hosts master replica of at least one queue
   # that has out-of-sync mirror.
   rabbitmq-diagnostics check_if_node_is_mirror_sync_critical

   # Exits with a non-zero code if one or more quorum queues will lose online quorum
   # should target node be shut down
   rabbitmq-diagnostics check_if_node_is_quorum_critical
   ```

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#389](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/389)

 * Some proxy protocol errors are now logged at debug level. This reduces log noise in environments
   where TCP load balancers and proxies perform health checks by opening a TCP connection but never sending
   any data.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2204](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2204)



### Management and Management Agent Plugins

#### Bug Fixes

 * Consumer section on individual page was unintentionally hidden.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#758](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/758)

 * Policies that quorum queues ignored were still listed as applied to them.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2210](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2210)

#### Enhancements

 * An undocumented "automagic login" feature on the login form was removed.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#748](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/748)

 * A new `POST /login` endpoint can be used by custom management UI login forms to authenticate the user
   and set the cookie.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#764](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/764)

 * Warning about a missing `handle.exe` in `PATH` on Windows is now only logged every few minutes.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management-agent#90](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management-agent/issues/90)

 * `rabbitmqadmin declare queue` now supports a new `queue_type` parameter to simplify declaration of
   quorum queues.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#761](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/761)

 * HTTP API request log entries now includes acting user.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#760](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/760)

 * [Content Security Policy headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) are now also set for static assets such as JavaScript files.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#767](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/767)


### Kubernetes Peer Discovery Plugin

#### Enhancements

   The plugin will now notify [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.16/#event-v1-core) of node startup and peer stop/unavailability events.

   Contributed by Gabriele Santomaggio.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-k8s#61](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-k8s/pull/61)


### Federation Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * "Command" operations such as binding propagation now use a separate channel for all links,
   preventing latency spikes for asynchronous operations (such as message publishing)
   (a head-of-line blocking problem).

   Contributed by Grigory Starinkin.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#97](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/pull/97)


### Auth Backend OAuth 2 Plugin

 * Additional scopes can be fetched from a predefined JWT token field. Those scopes will be combined
   with the standard scopes field.

   Contributed by @papugamichal.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2#41](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2/pull/41)


### Trust Store Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * HTTPS certificate provider will not longer terminate if upstream service response contains
   invalid JSON.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-trust-store#73](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-trust-store/issues/73)

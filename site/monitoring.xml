  <body show-in-this-page="true">
    <p class="intro">This document is intended to guide you on which RabbitMQ and system metrics
      are most important to monitor. Monitoring your RabbitMQ installation is an effective means
      to intercept issues before they affect the rest of your environment and, eventually, your
      users.

      <doc:heading>Infrastructure and Kernel Metrics</doc:heading>

      <p>
        First step towards a useful monitoring system starts with infrastructure and
        kernel metrics. There are quite a few of them but some are more important than others.
        The following metrics should be monitored on all nodes in a RabbitMQ cluster and, if possible,
        all nodes that host applications:

        <ul>
          <li>CPU (idle, user, system, iowait)</li>
          <li>Memory (free, cached, buffered)</li>
          <li>Disk I/O (reads &amp; writes per unit time, I/O wait percentages)</li>
          <li>Free Disk Space</li>
          <li>File descriptors used by <code>beam.smp</code> vs. max system limit</li>
          <li>Network throughput (bytes received, bytes sent) vs. maximum network link throughput</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt">VM</a> statistics (dirty page flushes, writeback volume)</li>
          <li>System load average (<code>/proc/loadavg</code>)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        There is no shortage of existing tools (such as Graphite or Datadog) that collect infrastructure
        and kernel metrics, store and visualise them over periods of time.

      <p>
        The RabbitMQ <a href="management.html">management plugin</a> provides a starting point for
        monitoring RabbitMQ metrics. One limitation, however, is that only up to one day's worth of
        metrics are stored. Storing historical metrics can be an important tool to determine the root
        cause of issues affecting your users or to plan for future capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        RabbitMQ metrics are made available through the <a href="management.html#http-api">HTTP API</a>
        via the <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/&version-server-tag;/priv/www/api/index.html"><code>api/queues/<i>vhost</i>/<i>qname</i></code></a>
        endpoint. It is recommended to collect metrics at 60 second intervals because more frequent
        collection may place too much load on the RabbitMQ server and negatively affect performance.

      <doc:heading>Application-level Metrics</doc:heading>
      <p>
        A system that uses RabbitMQ, or any messaging-based system, is almost always distributed or can
        be treated as such. In such systems it is often not immediately obvious which component
        is problematic. Every single one of them, including applications, should be monitored and
        investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some infrastructure-level and RabbitMQ metrics can demonstrate
       presence of an unusual system behaviour or issue but can't pin
       point the root cause. For example, it is easy to tell that a
       node is running out of disk space but not always easy to tell why.
       This is where application metrics come in: they can help identify
       a run-away publisher, a repeatedly failing consumer, a consumer that cannot
       keep up with the rate, even a downstream service that's experiencing a slowdown
       (e.g. a missing index in a database used by the consumers).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some client libraries (e.g. RabbitMQ Java client) and frameworks (e.g. Spring AMQP)
        provide means of registering metrics collectors or collect metrics out of the box.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="log-collection">
      <doc:heading>Log Aggregation</doc:heading>
      <p>
        While not technically a metric, one more piece of information can be very useful
        in troubleshooting a multi-service distributed system: logs. Consider collecting logs
        from all RabbitMQ nodes as well as all applications (if possible). Like metrics,
        logs can provide important clues that will help identify the root cause.

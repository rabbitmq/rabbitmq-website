    <title>RabbitMQ - Platforms</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      Our goal is for RabbitMQ to run on as wide a range of platforms as
      possible. RabbitMQ can run on any platform that Erlang supports,
      from embedded systems to multi-core clusters and cloud-based servers.
    </p>

    <p id="erlang-supported">
      The following platforms are supported by Erlang and could therefore
      run RabbitMQ:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>Solaris</li>
        <li>BSD</li>
        <li>Linux</li>
        <li>MacOSX</li>
        <li>TRU64</li>
        <li>Vista/Windows 7</li>
        <li>Windows NT/2000/2003/XP</li>
        <li>Windows 95, 98</li>
        <li>VxWorks</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p id="rabbit-supported">
      RabbitMQ is officially supported on a smaller number of platforms:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>Ubuntu and Debian-based Linux distributions</li>
        <li>Fedora and RPM-based Linux distributions</li>
        <li>openSUSE and derived distributions (including SLES and SLERT)</li>
        <li>Mac OS X</li>
        <li>Windows XP or later</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ will run on Windows XP and later (Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7,
      Server 2008). It should be possible to run on Windows NT and Windows 2000
      as well, but this has not been tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Windows Erlang VM is 32bit. RabbitMQ will run on 64bit systems as a
      32bit process, but some 32bit limitations (such as maximum addressable
      memory) will be apparant.
    </p>

    <h3 id="unix">Generic UNIX</h3>
    <p>
      While not officially supported, Erlang and hence RabbitMQ can run on most
      systems with a POSIX layer including Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
      and many more.
    </p>

    <h3>Virtual Platforms</h3>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ can run on physical or emulated hardware. This also allows
      unsupported platforms that are able to emulate a supported platform to
      run RabbitMQ.
    </p>
    <p>
       See the <a href="ec2.html">EC2 guide</a> for details on
      running on RabbitMQ on Amazon EC2.
    </p>

    <h2 id="unsupported">Unsupported Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      Some platforms are not supported and probably never will be:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>z/OS and most mainframes</li>
        <li>Memory-constrained systems (&lt; 16Mb RAM)</li>
      </ul>

      If your platform is on this list or you need assistance then

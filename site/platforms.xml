    <title>Supported Platforms</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="intro">
      Our goal is for RabbitMQ to run on as wide a range of platforms as
      possible. RabbitMQ can potentially run on any platform that Erlang
      supports, from embedded systems to multi-core clusters and cloud-based
      servers.
    </p>

    <p id="erlang-supported">
      The following platforms are supported by Erlang and could therefore
      run RabbitMQ:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>Linux</li>
        <li>Windows, NT through 10</li>
        <li>Windows Server 2003/2008/2012</li>
        <li>Mac OS X</li>
        <li>Solaris</li>
        <li>FreeBSD</li>
        <li>TRU64</li>
        <li>VxWorks</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p id="rabbit-supported">
      The open source release of RabbitMQ is most commonly deployed on the
      following platforms:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>Ubuntu and Debian-based Linux distributions</li>
        <li>Fedora, CentOS and RPM-based Linux distributions</li>
        <li>openSUSE and derived distributions (including SLES and SLERT)</li>
        <li>Mac OS X</li>
        <li>Windows XP and later</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ will run on Windows XP and later (Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8,
      Windows 10, Server 2008 and Server 2012). It should be possible to run on Windows NT and
      Windows 2000 as well although this has not been tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 64 bit Windows Erlang VM is available as of R15. Running the most recent
      64 bit version of Erlang is recommended. See <a href="/which-erlang.html">Erlang version compatibility page</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="unix">Generic UNIX</h3>
    <p>
      While not officially supported, Erlang and hence RabbitMQ can run on most
      systems with a POSIX layer including Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
      and many more.
    </p>

    <h3>Virtualized Platforms</h3>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ can run on physical or virtual hardware. This also allows
      unsupported platforms that are able to emulate a supported platform to
      run RabbitMQ.
    </p>
    <p>
       See the <a href="ec2.html">EC2 guide</a> for details on
      running on RabbitMQ on Amazon EC2.
    </p>

    <h2 id="commercial">Commercially Supported Platforms</h2>
    <p>A list of platforms for which you can purchase commercial support for
       RabbitMQ is available in the
       <a href="http://rabbitmq.docs.pivotal.io/index.html">
         commercial RabbitMQ distribution documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="unsupported">Unsupported Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      Some platforms are not supported and probably never will be:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>z/OS and most mainframes</li>
        <li>Memory-constrained systems (&lt; 32 MB of RAM)</li>
      </ul>

      If your platform is on this list or you need assistance then
      please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.

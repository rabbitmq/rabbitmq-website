    <title>Supported Platforms</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="intro">
      Our goal is for RabbitMQ to run on as wide a range of platforms as
      possible. RabbitMQ can potentially run on any platform that provides
      <a href="/which-erlang.html">a supported Erlang version</a>, from multi-core nodes and cloud-based
      deployments to embedded systems.
    </p>

    <p id="erlang-supported">
      The following platforms are supported by Erlang and could therefore
      run RabbitMQ:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>Linux</li>
        <li>Windows, NT through 10</li>
        <li>Windows Server 2008 through 2018</li>
        <li>MacOS</li>
        <li>Solaris</li>
        <li>FreeBSD</li>
        <li>TRU64</li>
        <li>VxWorks</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p id="rabbit-supported">
      The open source release of RabbitMQ is most commonly used and deployed on the
      following platforms:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>Ubuntu and Debian-based Linux distributions</li>
        <li>Fedora, CentOS and RPM-based Linux distributions</li>
        <li>Windows Server</li>
        <li>MacOS</li>
        <li>openSUSE and derived distributions (including SLES and SLERT)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ will run on any Windows version that <a href="/which-erlang.html">supported Erlang/OTP</a>
      releases can run on, both desktop and server editions. This includes
      Windows 7 through 10, Server 2008 through 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows XP, Vista, and Server 2003 may require using an older
      version of Erlang/OTP and RabbitMQ. Please consult <a href="http://previous.rabbitmq.com/">documentation archive</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 64 bit Windows Erlang VM is available as of R15. Running a recent
      64 bit version of Erlang is recommended. See <a href="/which-erlang.html">Erlang version compatibility page</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="unix">Other Flavours of UNIX</h3>
    <p>
      While not officially supported, Erlang and hence RabbitMQ can run on most
      systems with a POSIX layer including FreeBSD, Solaris, NetBSD, OpenBSD
      and many more.
    </p>

    <h3>Virtualized Platforms</h3>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ can run on physical or virtual hardware, including many
      IaaS providers. This also allows unsupported platforms that are
      able to emulate a supported platform to run RabbitMQ.
    </p>
    <p>
       A number of companies offer RabbitMQ-as-a-service in multiple clouds. Please see  <a href="/download.html">Installation Guide</a>
       to learn more.
    </p>

    <h2 id="commercial">Commercially Supported Platforms</h2>
    <p>A list of platforms for which you can purchase commercial support for
       RabbitMQ is available in the
       <a href="http://rabbitmq.docs.pivotal.io/index.html">
         commercial RabbitMQ distribution documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="unsupported">Unsupported Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      Some platforms are not supported and probably never will be:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>z/OS and most mainframes</li>
        <li>Memory-constrained systems (&lt; 32 MB of RAM)</li>
      </ul>

      If your platform is on this list or you need assistance then
      please <a href="contact.html">contact Pivotal</a>.

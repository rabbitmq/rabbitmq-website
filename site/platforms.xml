    <title>RabbitMQ - Platforms</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      Our goal is for RabbitMQ to run on as wide a range of platforms as
      possible. RabbitMQ can potentially run on any platform that Erlang
      supports, from embedded systems to multi-core clusters and cloud-based
      servers.
    </p>

    <p id="erlang-supported">
      The following platforms are supported by Erlang and could therefore
      run RabbitMQ:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>Solaris</li>
        <li>BSD</li>
        <li>Linux</li>
        <li>MacOSX</li>
        <li>TRU64</li>
        <li>Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/Windows 7</li>
        <li>Windows Server 2003/2008</li>
        <li>Windows 95, 98</li>
        <li>VxWorks</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p id="rabbit-supported">
      The open source release of RabbitMQ is officially supported on a
      limited number of platforms:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>Ubuntu and Debian-based Linux distributions</li>
        <li>Fedora and RPM-based Linux distributions</li>
        <li>openSUSE and derived distributions (including SLES and SLERT)</li>
        <li>Mac OS X</li>
        <li>Windows XP and later</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p id="vfabric-rabbit-supported">
      Commerical support for <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vfabric-rabbitmq/overview.html">vFabric RabbitMQ</a>,
      both the vFabric Advanced and vFabric RabbitMQ standalone editions, is available for the following platforms:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (64 bit)</li>
        <li>RHEL 5 and CentOS 5 (32 and 64 bit)</li>
        <li>Windows 2003 (32 bit) and 2008 (32 and 64 bit)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ will run on Windows XP and later (Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7,
      Server 2008). It should be possible to run on Windows NT and Windows 2000
      as well although this has not been tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Windows Erlang VM is 32bit. RabbitMQ will run on 64bit systems as a
      32bit process but <a href="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2010-April/006794.html">some
      32bit limitations</a> (such as maximum addressable memory) will be apparent. 
    </p>

    <h3 id="unix">Generic UNIX</h3>
    <p>
      While not officially supported, Erlang and hence RabbitMQ can run on most
      systems with a POSIX layer including Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
      and many more.
    </p>

    <h3>Virtual Platforms</h3>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ can run on physical or emulated hardware. This also allows
      unsupported platforms that are able to emulate a supported platform to
      run RabbitMQ.
    </p>
    <p>
       See the <a href="ec2.html">EC2 guide</a> for details on
      running on RabbitMQ on Amazon EC2.
    </p>

    <h2 id="unsupported">Unsupported Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      Some platforms are not supported and probably never will be:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>z/OS and most mainframes</li>
        <li>Memory-constrained systems (&lt; 16Mb RAM)</li>
      </ul>

      If your platform is on this list or you need assistance then
      please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.

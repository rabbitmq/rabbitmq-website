    <title>Supported Platforms</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="intro">
      Our goal is for RabbitMQ to run on as wide a range of platforms as
      possible. RabbitMQ can potentially run on any platform that Erlang
      supports, from embedded systems to multi-core clusters and cloud-based
      servers.
    </p>

    <p id="erlang-supported">
      The following platforms are supported by Erlang and could therefore
      run RabbitMQ:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>Solaris</li>
        <li>BSD</li>
        <li>Linux</li>
        <li>MacOSX</li>
        <li>TRU64</li>
        <li>Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8</li>
        <li>Windows Server 2003/2008/2012</li>
        <li>Windows 95, 98</li>
        <li>VxWorks</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p id="rabbit-supported">
      The open source release of RabbitMQ is most commonly deployed on the
      following platforms:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>Ubuntu and Debian-based Linux distributions</li>
        <li>Fedora and RPM-based Linux distributions</li>
        <li>openSUSE and derived distributions (including SLES and SLERT)</li>
        <li>Mac OS X</li>
        <li>Windows XP and later</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ will run on Windows XP and later (Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8,
      Server 2008 and Server 2012). It should be possible to run on Windows NT and
      Windows 2000 as well although this has not been tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Windows Erlang VM is available as 32bit (all available versions) and 64bit
      versions (since R15B). Some limitations (such as address space) will be apparent when
      running a 32bit Erlang VM on 64bit hardware.
    </p>

    <h3 id="unix">Generic UNIX</h3>
    <p>
      While not officially supported, Erlang and hence RabbitMQ can run on most
      systems with a POSIX layer including Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
      and many more.
    </p>

    <h3>Virtual Platforms</h3>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ can run on physical or emulated hardware. This also allows
      unsupported platforms that are able to emulate a supported platform to
      run RabbitMQ.
    </p>
    <p>
       See the <a href="ec2.html">EC2 guide</a> for details on
      running on RabbitMQ on Amazon EC2.
    </p>

    <h2 id="commercial">Commercially Supported Platforms</h2>
    <p>A list of platforms for which you can purchase commercial support for
       RabbitMQ is available in the
       <a href="https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/vfabric-rabbitmq.html">
         RabbitMQ commercial documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="unsupported">Unsupported Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      Some platforms are not supported and probably never will be:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>z/OS and most mainframes</li>
        <li>Memory-constrained systems (&lt; 16Mb RAM)</li>
      </ul>

      If your platform is on this list or you need assistance then
      please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.

    <title>.NET/C# AMQP client library and WCF binding</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The RabbitMQ .NET client is an implementation of an AMQP 0-9-1 client
      library for C# (and, implicitly, other .NET languages), and a
      Microsoft's Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) binding that communicates
      over RabbitMQ.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library is open-source, and is dual-licensed under <a
      href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">the Apache
      License v2</a> and <a href="mpl.html">the Mozilla Public License
      v1.1</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to compile or run the RabbitMQ .NET/C# client library,
      you will need an appropriate .NET SDK or runtime environment
      available, respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      The .NET/C# RabbitMQ client library should be used in preference to the
      WCF binding where possible. The WCF binding suffers from a number
      of limitations and no further development is planned for it.
      The limitations are described in the WCF Service Model documentation.
    </p>

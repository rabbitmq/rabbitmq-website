    <title>.NET/C# RabbitMQ client library</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The RabbitMQ .NET client is an implementation of an AMQP 0-9-1 client
      library for C# (and, implicitly, other .NET languages). Starting with the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rabbitmq-users/.NET$20client$204.0%7Csort:relevance/rabbitmq-users/mzZ1AoFM4Bk/5ahmQEj6AwAJ">4.0 release</a> release it supports .NET Core
      and .NET 4.5.1+.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library is <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client">open-source</a>, and is dual-licensed under <a
      href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">the Apache
      License v2</a> and <a href="mpl.html">the Mozilla Public License
      v1.1</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recent versions of the library are exclusively <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/RabbitMQ.Client">distributed via NuGet</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The .NET/C# RabbitMQ client library should be used in preference to the
      WCF binding where possible. The WCF binding suffers from a number
      of limitations and no further development is planned for it.
      The limitations are described in the WCF Service Model documentation.
    </p>

  <li>4369: <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/epmd.html">epmd</a>, a peer discovery service used by RabbitMQ nodes and CLI tools</li>
  <li>5672, 5671: used by AMQP 0-9-1 and 1.0 clients without and with TLS</li>
  <li>
    25672: used for inter-node and CLI tools communication (Erlang distribution server port)
    and is allocated from a dynamic range (limited to a single port by default,
    computed as AMQP port + 20000). Unless external connections on these ports are really necessary (e.g.
    the cluster uses <a href="/federation.html">federation</a> or CLI tools are used on machines outside the subnet),
    these ports should not be publicly exposed. See <a href="/networking.html">networking guide</a> for details.

    server distribution port + 10010). See <a href="/networking.html">networking guide</a> for details.

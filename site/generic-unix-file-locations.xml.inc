    <doc:heading>File Locations</doc:heading>
    <p>
      The generic binary build is designed to run without granted
      permissions to directories outside of its base one. The <a href="/relocate.html">directories and files</a> used by default are
      all held under the installation directory <code>rabbitmq_server-&version-server;</code>
      which is in the <span class="envvar">$RABBITMQ_HOME</span>
      variable in the scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The node can be <a href="/relocate.html">instructed</a> to use more
      conventional system directories for <a href="/configure.html">configuration</a>,
      node data directory, <a href="/logging.html">log</a> files, <a href="/plugins.html">plugins</a> and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to make the node use operating system defaults, locate the following line

<pre class="lang-shell">
SYS_PREFIX=${RABBITMQ_HOME}
</pre>

      in the <code>sbin/rabbitmq-defaults</code> script and
      change this line to:

<pre class="sourcecode">
SYS_PREFIX=
</pre>

      but do not modify any other line in this script.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important</strong>: after this modification the default directory
      locations may point to non-existent directories or directories that the effective
      node user won't have permissions for. In particular
      <strong>RABBITMQ_MNESIA_BASE</strong> and
      <strong>RABBITMQ_LOG_BASE</strong> may need to be created (the
      server will attempt to create them at startup), and the
      <strong>RABBITMQ_ENABLED_PLUGINS_FILE</strong> will need
      to be writable (for <a href="/cli.html">rabbitmq-plugins</a>).
      The configuration files will be looked for
      in <code>/etc/rabbitmq/</code>.
    </p>

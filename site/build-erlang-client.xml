        <title>Erlang AMQP Client Library Build Instructions</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <p class="intro">
        This section describes the process for obtaining a copy of the
        RabbitMQ Erlang AMQP client source code and its dependecies, as
        well as instructions for building the Erlang client from source.
      </p>

        <doc:heading>Obtaining the source</doc:heading>

        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Either download a released source code distribution from
            the <a href="erlang-client.html">download page</a>, or
          </li>

          <li>Check the code out directly from <a href="github.html">our GitHub repositories</a>:
          <pre class="lang-bash">
git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-erlang-client.git
cd rabbitmq-erlang-client
make
</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you choose to check the code out using Git, the necessary
          dependencies will be fetched automatically. If you're working with a
          released source code distribution, though, all necessary dependencies
          are included.

        <doc:heading>Building the Erlang client libraries</doc:heading>

        <p>
          If you ran the commands above, there is nothing else to do.
          The Erlang.mk build system compiled everything when you ran
          <code>make</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other interesting <code>Makefile</code> targets include
        </p>

        <p>
          <dl>
            <dt>all</dt>
            <dd>
              The default target. Builds the client libraries.
            </dd>

            <dt>shell</dt>
            <dd>
              Builds the client libraries and starts an Erlang shell with the
              libraries loaded.
            </dd>

            <dt>run-broker</dt>
            <dd>
              Builds the client and starts RabbitMQ server with shell
              and the client included in load path.
            </dd>

            <dt>clean</dt>
            <dd>
              Removes temporary build products.
            </dd>

            <dt>distclean</dt>
            <dd>
              Removes all build products.
            </dd>

            <dt>tests</dt>
            <dd>
              Runs a set of tests against a server running on
              locally.
            </dd>

            <dt>all_tests</dt>
            <dd>
              Clean compiles the client and client tests source code
              and runs <code>network_client_SUITE</code>,
              <code>direct_client_SUITE</code> and packaging
              tests. During testing, this make target runs an instance
              of the broker, so make sure there is no other instance
              of RabbitMQ server running.
            </dd>

            <dt>dialyze</dt>
            <dd>
              Analyses the client source code with dialyzer. Uses PLT
              file from default location:
              <code>~/.dialyzer_plt</code>. Use

              <pre class="lang-bash">
make PLT=/path/to/plt dialyze</pre>

              to override this. Add broker to PLT beforehand,
              otherwise you will a lot of 'unknown function'
              warnings. See <code>add_broker_to_plt</code> make
              target.
            </dd>

            <dt>source-dist</dt>
            <dd>
              Creates tarball of all the client source code.
            </dd>

            <dt>package</dt>
            <dd>
              Creates an erlang archive of the client.
            </dd>

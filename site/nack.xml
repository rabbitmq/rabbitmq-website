    <title>Negative Acknowledgements</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Consumers in AMQP 0-9-1 can choose to use <a href="/confirms.html">manual acknowledgements</a>
      of deliveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="/specification.html">AMQP 0-9-1 specification</a> defines the <code>basic.reject</code>
      method that allows clients to reject individual, delivered
      messages, instructing the broker to either discard them or
      requeue them. Unfortunately, <code>basic.reject</code>
      provides no support for negatively acknowledging messages in
      bulk.
    </p>

    <p>
      To solve this, RabbitMQ supports the <code>basic.nack</code>
      method that provides all the functionality of
      <code>basic.reject</code> whilst also allowing for bulk
      processing of messages.
    </p>

    <p>
      To reject messages in bulk, clients set the
      <code>multiple</code> flag of the <code>basic.nack</code>
      method to <code>true</code>. The broker will then reject all
      unacknowledged, delivered messages up to and including the
      message specified in the <code>delivery_tag</code> field of
      the <code>basic.nack</code> method. In this respect,
      <code>basic.nack</code> complements the bulk acknowledgement
      semantics of <code>basic.ack</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This example rejects a single message, asking the broker to requeue it:

      <pre class="sourcecode java">
GetResponse gr = channel.basicGet("some.queue", false);
channel.basicNack(gr.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag(), false, true);</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      This example rejects two messages with a single call to
      the broker (the second argument on
      <code>basicNack</code> is the <code>multiple</code> flag):

    <pre class="sourcecode java">
GetResponse gr1 = channel.basicGet("some.queue", false);
GetResponse gr2 = channel.basicGet("some.queue", false);
channel.basicNack(gr2.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag(), true, true);</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      When a message is requeued, it will be placed to its original
      position in its queue, if possible. If not (due to concurrent
      deliveries and acknowledgements from other consumers when
      multiple consumers share a queue), the message will be requeued
      to a position closer to queue head.

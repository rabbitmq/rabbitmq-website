      <p>
        This document describes authentication and authorisation machinery that
        implements access control.

        Authentication backends should not be confused with
        <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/authentication.html">authentication mechanisms</a>
        in AMQP 0-9-1.

      <p>
        Authentication and authorisation are often confused or used
        interchangeably. That's wrong and in RabbitMQ, the two are
        separated. For the sake of simplicity, we'll define
        authentication as "identifying who the user is" and
        authorisation as "determining what the user is and isn't
        allowed to do."

        <doc:heading>Default Virtual Host and User</doc:heading>
        <p>
          When the server first starts running, and detects that its
          database is uninitialised or has been deleted, it
          initialises a fresh database with the following resources:
        </p>

        <ul class="compact">
          <li>
            a virtual host named <code>/</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            a user named <code>guest</code> with a default password of
            <code>guest</code>, granted full access to the
            <code>/</code> virtual host.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It is advisable
          to <a href="man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html#delete_user">delete</a>
          the <code>guest</code> user
          or <a href="man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html#change_password">change
          the password</a> to something private, particularly if your
          broker is accessible publicly.
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="loopback-users">
        <doc:heading>"guest" user can only connect via localhost</doc:heading>
        <p>
          By default, the <code>guest</code> user is prohibited from
          connecting to the broker remotely; it can only connect over
          a loopback interface (i.e. <code>localhost</code>). This
          applies both to AMQP and to any other protocols enabled via
          plugins. Any other users you create will not (by default) be
          restricted in this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is configured via the <code>loopback_users</code> item
          in the <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">
          configuration file</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to allow the <code>guest</code> user to connect
          from a remote host, you should set the
          <code>loopback_users</code> configuration item to
          <code>[]</code>. A complete <code>rabbitmq.config</code>
          which does this would look like:

      <doc:section name="access-control">
        <doc:heading>How Permissions Work</doc:heading>
        <p>
          When a RabbitMQ client establishes a connection to a
          server, it specifies a virtual host within which it intends
          to operate. A first level of access control is enforced at
          this point, with the server checking whether the user has
          any permissions to access the virtual hosts, and rejecting
          the connection attempt otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          Resources, i.e. exchanges and queues, are named entities
          inside a particular virtual host; the same name denotes a
          different resource in each virtual host. A second level of
          access control is enforced when certain operations are
          performed on resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          RabbitMQ distinguishes between <em>configure</em>,
          <em>write</em> and <em>read</em> operations on a
          resource. The <em>configure</em> operations create or
          destroy resources, or alter their behaviour. The
          <em>write</em> operations inject messages into a
          resource. And the <em>read</em> operations retrieve messages
          from a resource.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to perform an operation on a resource the user must
          have been granted the appropriate permissions for it. The
          following table shows what permissions on what type of
          resource are required for all the AMQP commands which
          perform permission checks.
          <table>

            </tr>
          </table>
        </p>

        <p>
          Permissions are expressed as a triple of regular expressions
          - one each for configure, write and read - on per-vhost
          basis. The user is granted the respective permission for
          operations on all resources with names matching the regular
          expressions. <i>(Note: For convenience RabbitMQ maps AMQP's
          default exchange's blank name to 'amq.default' when
          performing permission checks.)</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          The regular expression <code>'^$'</code>, i.e. matching
          nothing but the empty string, covers all resources and
          effectively stops the user from performing any operation.
          Standard AMQP resource names are prefixed with
          <code>amq.</code> and server generated names are prefixed
          with <code>amq.gen</code>.  For example,
          <code>'^(amq\.gen.*|amq\.default)$'</code> gives a user access to
          server-generated names and the default exchange.  The empty
          string, <code>''</code> is a synonym for <code>'^$'</code>
          and restricts permissions in the exact same way.
        </p>

        <p>
          RabbitMQ may cache the results of access control checks on a
          per-connection or per-channel basis. Hence changes to user
          permissions may only take effect when the user reconnects.
        </p>
        <p>
          For details of how to set up access control, please see the
          <a href="man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html#Access%20control">Access Control section</a>

      <doc:section name="topic-authorisation">
        <doc:heading>Topic Authorisation</doc:heading>
        <p>
          As of version 3.7.0, RabbitMQ supports topic authorisation. Topic authorisation
          applies to publishing to topic-typed exchanges. The routing key of a message
          published to a topic exchange is also implied in the decision process when
          topic authorisation is enforced (e.g. in RabbitMQ default authorisation backend,
          the routing key is matched against a regular expression to decide whether the message can be
          routed downstream or not).
          Topic authorisation targets protocols like STOMP and MQTT, which are heavily
          relying on topic exchanges and routing keys under the covers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note topic authorisation is an additional security check: it is performed
          after the publishing-to-exchange check. This means publishing a message to a topic-typed
          exchange will go through both the publishing-to-exchange and the publishing-to-topic
          checks and the latter is never called if the former blocked the publishing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're using RabbitMQ default authorisation backend, publishing to topic-typed
          exchanges is always authorised if no topic permission has been created (the default
          on a fresh RabbitMQ installation).
          With this authorisation backend, consider
          topic authorisation as optional: you don't need to whitelist any exchanges,
          you just need to blacklist exchanges (understand "create topic permissions for those
          exchanges") if you want to use this feature.
          For details of how to set up topic permissions, please see the
          <a href="man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html#Access%20control">Access Control section</a>
          of the <a href="man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html">rabbitmqctl(1) man page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're using another authorisation backend (e.g. <a href="ldap.html">LDAP</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-http">HTTP</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-amqp">AMQP</a>), please refer
          to this authorisation backend documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're using your own authorisation backend, you need to know that
          topic authorisation is enforced with the <code>check_topic_access</code> callback
          of the <code>rabbit_authz_backend</code> behavior.
        </p>

      <doc:section name="backends">
        <doc:heading>Alternative Authentication and Authorisation Backends</doc:heading>

        <p>
          Authentication and authorisation are pluggable. Plugins can provide implementations
          of

          <ul>
            <li>authentication ("authn") backends</li>
            <li>authorisation ("authz") backends</li>
          </ul>

          It is possible for a plugin to provide both.
          For example the internal, <a href="/ldap.html">LDAP</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-http">HTTP</a>
          backends do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some plugins, for example, the <a
          href="https://github.com/gotthardp/rabbitmq-auth-backend-ip-range">Source
          IP range one</a>, only provide an authorisation backend. Authentication
          is supposed to be handled by the internal database, LDAP, etc.
        </p>
        
        <doc:subsection name="combined-backends">
          <doc:heading>Combining Backends</doc:heading>

          <p>
            It is possible to use multiple backends for
            <code>authn</code> or <code>authz</code> using the
            <code>rabbit.auth_backends</code> configuration key. When
            several authentication backends are used then the first
            positive result returned by a backend in the chain is
            considered to be final. This should not be confused with
            mixed backends (for example, using LDAP for authentication and internal
            backend for authorisation).
          </p>

          <p>
            The following example configures RabbitMQ to use the internal backend
            only (and is the default):
          </p>
            
<pre class="example">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_internal]}
          ]
}].
</pre>

          <p>
            The following example configures RabbitMQ to use the <a href="/ldap.html">LDAP backend</a>
            for both authentication and authorisation. Internal database will not be consulted:
          </p>
            
<pre class="example">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_ldap]}
          ]
}].
</pre>

      <p>
        This will check LDAP first, and then fall back to the internal
        database if the user cannot be authenticated through LDAP:
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_ldap, rabbit_auth_backend_internal]}
          ]
}].
      </pre>
      
      <p>
        Same as above but will fall back to the <a
        href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-http">HTTP backend</a>
        instead:
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_ldap, rabbit_auth_backend_http]}
          ]
 },
 %% See HTTP backend docs for details
 {rabbitmq_auth_backend_http,
   [{user_path,     "http://my-authenticator-app/auth/user"},
    {vhost_path,    "http://my-authenticator-app/auth/vhost"},
    {resource_path, "http://my-authenticator-app/auth/resource"},
    {topic_path,    "http://my-authenticator-app/auth/topic"}]}].
</pre>      


          <p>
            The following example configures RabbitMQ to use internal
            database for authentication and <a
            href="https://github.com/gotthardp/rabbitmq-auth-backend-ip-range">source
            IP range backend</a> for authorisation:
          </p>
            
<pre class="example">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [{rabbit_auth_backend_internal, rabbit_auth_backend_ip_range}]}
          ]
}].
</pre>


      <p>
        The following example configures RabbitMQ to use <a href="/ldap.html">LDAP backend</a>
        for authentication and but internal backend for authorisation:
      </p>
<pre class="example">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [{rabbit_auth_backend_ldap, rabbit_auth_backend_internal}]
          ]}].
</pre>

      <p>
        The example below is fairly advanced. It will check LDAP
        first. If the user is found in LDAP then the password will be
        checked against LDAP and subsequent authorisation checks will
        be performed against the internal database (therefore users in
        LDAP must exist in the internal database as well, but do not
        need a password there). If the user is not found in LDAP then
        a second attempt is made using only the internal database:
      </p>

<pre class="example">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [{rabbit_auth_backend_ldap, rabbit_auth_backend_internal},
                             rabbit_auth_backend_internal]
          ]
 }].

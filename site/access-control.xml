        This document describes authentication and authorisation machinery that
        implements access control.

        Authentication backends should not be confused with
        <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/authentication.html">authentication mechanisms</a>
        in AMQP 0-9-1.
      </p>
      <p>
        A separate guide covers multiple topics around <a href="/passwords.html">passwords</a>.
        It is only applicable to the internal authentication backend.

      <p>
        Authentication and authorisation are often confused or used
        interchangeably. That's wrong and in RabbitMQ, the two are
        separated. For the sake of simplicity, we'll define
        authentication as "identifying who the user is" and
        authorisation as "determining what the user is and isn't
        allowed to do."

      <doc:section name="default-state">
        <doc:heading>Default Virtual Host and User</doc:heading>
        <p>
          When the server first starts running, and detects that its
          database is uninitialised or has been deleted, it
          initialises a fresh database with the following resources:
        </p>

        <ul class="compact">
          <li>
            a virtual host named <code>/</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            a user named <code>guest</code> with a default password of
            <code>guest</code>, granted full access to the
            <code>/</code> virtual host.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It is advisable
          to <a href="rabbitmqctl.8.html#delete_user">delete</a>
          the <code>guest</code> user
          or <a href="rabbitmqctl.8.html#change_password">change
          the password</a> to a password that's not publicly known.
        </p>

      <doc:section name="loopback-users">
        <doc:heading>"guest" user can only connect via localhost</doc:heading>
        <p>
          By default, the <code>guest</code> user is prohibited from
          connecting to the broker remotely; it can only connect over
          a loopback interface (i.e. <code>localhost</code>). This
          applies both to AMQP 0-9-1 and to any other protocols enabled via
          plugins. Any other users you create will not (by default) be
          restricted in this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recommended way to address this in production systems
          is to create a new user or set of users with the permissions
          to access the necessary virtual hosts. This can be done
          using <a href="/cli.html">CLI tools</a>, <a href="/management.html">HTTP API or definitions import</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is configured via the <code>loopback_users</code> item
          in the <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">
          configuration file</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to allow the <code>guest</code> user to connect
          from a remote host, you should set the
          <code>loopback_users</code> configuration to
          <code>none</code>. A complete <a href="/configure.html">RabbitMQ config file</a>
          which does this would look like:
        </p>

<pre class="sourcecode ini">
loopback_users = none
</pre>

        Or, in the <a href="/configure.html#erlang-term-config-file">classic config file format</a> (<code>rabbitmq.config</code>):

      <doc:section name="permissions">
        <doc:heading>How Permissions Work</doc:heading>
        <p>
          When a RabbitMQ client establishes a connection to a
          server, it specifies a virtual host within which it intends
          to operate. A first level of access control is enforced at
          this point, with the server checking whether the user has
          any permissions to access the virtual hosts, and rejecting
          the connection attempt otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          Resources, i.e. exchanges and queues, are named entities
          inside a particular virtual host; the same name denotes a
          different resource in each virtual host. A second level of
          access control is enforced when certain operations are
          performed on resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          RabbitMQ distinguishes between <em>configure</em>,
          <em>write</em> and <em>read</em> operations on a
          resource. The <em>configure</em> operations create or
          destroy resources, or alter their behaviour. The
          <em>write</em> operations inject messages into a
          resource. And the <em>read</em> operations retrieve messages
          from a resource.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to perform an operation on a resource the user must
          have been granted the appropriate permissions for it. The
          following table shows what permissions on what type of
          resource are required for all the AMQP commands which
          perform permission checks.

            </tr>
          </table>
        </p>

        <p>
          Permissions are expressed as a triple of regular expressions
          - one each for configure, write and read - on per-vhost
          basis. The user is granted the respective permission for
          operations on all resources with names matching the regular
          expressions. <i>(Note: For convenience RabbitMQ maps AMQP's
          default exchange's blank name to 'amq.default' when
          performing permission checks.)</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          The regular expression <code>'^$'</code>, i.e. matching
          nothing but the empty string, covers all resources and
          effectively stops the user from performing any operation.
          Standard AMQP resource names are prefixed with
          <code>amq.</code> and server generated names are prefixed
          with <code>amq.gen</code>.  For example,
          <code>'^(amq\.gen.*|amq\.default)$'</code> gives a user access to
          server-generated names and the default exchange.  The empty
          string, <code>''</code> is a synonym for <code>'^$'</code>
          and restricts permissions in the exact same way.
        </p>

        <p>
          RabbitMQ may cache the results of access control checks on a
          per-connection or per-channel basis. Hence changes to user
          permissions may only take effect when the user reconnects.
        </p>
        <p>

          <a href="rabbitmqctl.8.html#Access_Control">Access Control section</a>

          <p>
            In addition to the permissions covered above, users can have tags
            associated with them. Currently only management UI access is  controlled by user tags.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tags are managed using <a href="/rabbitmqctl.8.html#set_user_tags">rabbitmqctl</a>.
            Newly created users do not have any tags set on them by default.

      <doc:section name="topic-authorisation">
        <doc:heading>Topic Authorisation</doc:heading>
        <p>
          As of version 3.7.0, RabbitMQ supports topic authorisation for topic exchanges. The routing key of a message
          published to a topic exchange is taken into account when
          publishing authorisation is enforced (e.g. in RabbitMQ default authorisation backend,
          the routing key is matched against a regular expression to decide whether the message can be
          routed downstream or not).
          Topic authorisation targets protocols like STOMP and MQTT, which are structured
          around topics and use topic exchanges under the hood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Topic authorisation is an additional layer on top of
          existing checks for publishers. Publishing a
          message to a topic-typed exchange will go through both the
          <code>basic.publish</code> and the routing key checks.
          The latter is never called if the former refuses access.
        </p>
        <p>
          Topic authorisation can also be enforced for topic consumers.
          Note that it works different for different protocols. The concept
          of topic authorisation only really makes sense for the topic-oriented protocols such as MQTT
          and STOMP. In AMQP 0-9-1, for example, consumers consume from queues
          and thus the standard resource permissions apply. In addition for AMQP 0-9-1,
          binding routing keys between an AMQP 0-9-1 topic exchange and
          a queue/exchange are checked against the topic permissions configured, if any.
          For more information about how RabbitMQ handles authorization for topics, please see
          the <a href="stomp.html">STOMP</a> and <a href="mqtt.html">MQTT</a>
          documentation guides.
        </p>
        <p>
          When default authorisation backend is used, publishing to a
          topic exchange or consuming from a topic is always authorised
          if no topic permissions
          are defined (which is the case on a fresh RabbitMQ
          installation). With this authorisation backend, topic
          authorisation as optional: you don't need to whitelist any
          exchanges. To use topic authorisation therefore you need to opt in
          and define topic permissions for one or more exchanges. For details please see the <a
          href="rabbitmqctl.8.html#Access%20control">Access
          Control section</a> of the <a
          href="rabbitmqctl.8.html">rabbitmqctl man
          page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Internal (default) authorisation backend supports variable expansion
          in permission patterns.
          Three variables are supported: <code>username</code>, <code>vhost</code>,
          and <code>client_id</code>. Note that <code>client_id</code> only
          applies to MQTT. For example, if <code>tonyg</code> is the
          connected user, the permission <code>^{username}-.*</code> is expanded to
          <code>^tonyg-.*</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          If a different authorisation backend (e.g. <a href="ldap.html">LDAP</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-http">HTTP</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-amqp">AMQP</a>) is used, please refer
          to the documentation of those backends.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a custom authorisation backend is used, topic
          authorisation is enforced by implementing the
          <code>check_topic_access</code> callback of the
          <code>rabbit_authz_backend</code> behavior.
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="backends">
        <doc:heading>Alternative Authentication and Authorisation Backends</doc:heading>

        <p>
          Authentication and authorisation are pluggable. Plugins can provide implementations
          of

          <ul>
            <li>authentication ("authn") backends</li>
            <li>authorisation ("authz") backends</li>
          </ul>

          It is possible for a plugin to provide both.
          For example the internal, <a href="/ldap.html">LDAP</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-http">HTTP</a>
          backends do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some plugins, for example, the <a
          href="https://github.com/gotthardp/rabbitmq-auth-backend-ip-range">Source
          IP range one</a>, only provide an authorisation backend. Authentication
          is supposed to be handled by the internal database, LDAP, etc.
        </p>

        <doc:subsection name="combined-backends">
          <doc:heading>Combining Backends</doc:heading>

          <p>
            It is possible to use multiple backends for
            <code>authn</code> or <code>authz</code> using the
            <code>auth_backends</code> configuration key. When
            several authentication backends are used then the first
            positive result returned by a backend in the chain is
            considered to be final. This should not be confused with
            mixed backends (for example, using LDAP for authentication and internal
            backend for authorisation).
          </p>

          <p>
            The following example configures RabbitMQ to use the internal backend
            only (and is the default):
          </p>

<pre class="sourcecode ini">
# rabbitmq.conf
#
# 1 here is a backend name. It can be anything.
# Since we only really care about backend
# ordering, we use numbers throughout this guide.
#
# "internal" is an alias for rabbit_auth_backend_internal
auth_backends.1 = internal
</pre>

          Or, in the <a href="/configure.html#erlang-term-config-file">classic config format</a>:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_internal]}
          ]
}].
</pre>

          <p>
            The example above uses an alias, <code>internal</code> for <code>rabbit_auth_backend_internal</code>.
            The following aliases are available:

            <ul>
              <li><code>internal</code> for <code>rabbit_auth_backend_internal</code></li>
              <li><code>ldap</code> for <code>rabbit_auth_backend_ldap</code> (from the <a href="/ldap.html">LDAP plugin</a>)</li>
              <li><code>http</code> for <code>rabbit_auth_backend_http</code> (from the <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-http">HTTP auth backend plugin</a>)</li>
              <li><code>amqp</code> for <code>rabbit_auth_backend_amqp</code> (from the <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-amqp">AMQP 0-9-1 auth backend plugin</a>)</li>
              <li><code>dummy</code> for <code>rabbit_auth_backend_dummy</code></li>
            </ul>

            When using third party plugins, providing a full module name is necessary.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following example configures RabbitMQ to use the <a href="/ldap.html">LDAP backend</a>
            for both authentication and authorisation. Internal database will not be consulted:
          </p>

<pre class="sourcecode ini">
auth_backends.1 = ldap
</pre>

          Or, in the <a href="/configure.html#erlang-term-config-file">classic config format</a>:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_ldap]}
          ]
}].
</pre>

      <p>
        This will check LDAP first, and then fall back to the internal
        database if the user cannot be authenticated through LDAP:
      </p>

<pre class="sourcecode ini">
auth_backends.1 = ldap
auth_backends.2 = internal
</pre>

          Or, in the <a href="/configure.html#erlang-term-config-file">classic config format</a>:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_ldap, rabbit_auth_backend_internal]}
          ]
}].
</pre>

      <p>
        Same as above but will fall back to the <a
        href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-http">HTTP backend</a>
        instead:
      </p>

<pre class="sourcecode ini">
# rabbitmq.conf

            The following example configures RabbitMQ to use the internal
            database for authentication and the <a
            href="https://github.com/gotthardp/rabbitmq-auth-backend-ip-range">source
            IP range backend</a> for authorisation:
          </p>

<pre class="sourcecode ini">
# rabbitmq.conf
#
auth_backends.1.authn = internal
# uses module name because this backend is from a 3rd party
auth_backends.1.authz = rabbit_auth_backend_ip_range
</pre>

          Or, in the <a href="/configure.html#erlang-term-config-file">classic config format</a>:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [{rabbit_auth_backend_internal, rabbit_auth_backend_ip_range}]}
          ]
}].
</pre>


      <p>
        The following example configures RabbitMQ to use the <a href="/ldap.html">LDAP backend</a>
        for authentication and the internal backend for authorisation:
      </p>

<pre class="sourcecode ini">
# rabbitmq.conf
#
auth_backends.1.authn = ldap
auth_backends.1.authz = internal
</pre>

          Or, in the <a href="/configure.html#erlang-term-config-file">classic config format</a>:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [{rabbit_auth_backend_ldap, rabbit_auth_backend_internal}]
          ]}].
</pre>

      <p>
        The example below is fairly advanced. It will check LDAP
        first. If the user is found in LDAP then the password will be
        checked against LDAP and subsequent authorisation checks will
        be performed against the internal database (therefore users in
        LDAP must exist in the internal database as well, but do not
        need a password there). If the user is not found in LDAP then
        a second attempt is made using only the internal database:
      </p>

<pre class="sourcecode ini">
# rabbitmq.conf
#
auth_backends.1.authn = ldap
auth_backends.1.authz = internal
auth_backends.2       = internal
</pre>

          Or, in the <a href="/configure.html#erlang-term-config-file">classic config format</a>:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[{rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [{rabbit_auth_backend_ldap, rabbit_auth_backend_internal},
                             rabbit_auth_backend_internal]}
          ]
}].

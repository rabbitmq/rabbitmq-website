    <title>Memory Alarms</title>

    <!--
       To avoid terminology soup:
       - "memory threshold" always refers to the configured fraction
       - "memory limit" always refers to the computed absolute limit
    -->
    <p>
      The RabbitMQ server detects the total amount of
      RAM installed in the computer on startup and when
      <code>rabbitmqctl
      set_vm_memory_high_watermark <em>fraction</em></code> is
      executed. By default, when the RabbitMQ server uses above 40%
      of the installed RAM, it raises a memory alarm and blocks all
      connections. Once the memory alarm has cleared (e.g. due
      to the server paging messages to disk or delivering them to
      clients) normal service resumes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The default memory threshold is set to 40% of installed
      RAM. Note that this does not prevent the RabbitMQ server
      from using more than 40%, it is merely the point at which
      publishers are throttled. Erlang's garbage collector can, in
      the worst case, cause double the amount of memory to be used
      (by default, 80% of RAM). It is strongly recommended that OS
      swap or page files are enabled.
    </p>

    <p>
      32-bit architectures tend to impose a per process memory limit
      of 2GB. Common implementations of 64-bit architectures
      (i.e. AMD64 and Intel EM64T) permit only a paltry 256TB per
      process. 64-bit Windows further limits this to 8TB. However,
      note that even under 64-bit OSes, a 32-bit process frequently
      only has a maximum address space of 2GB.
    </p>
    <doc:section name="memsup-usage">
      <doc:heading>Configuring the Memory Threshold</doc:heading>

      <p>
        The memory threshold at which the flow control is triggered
        can be adjusted by editing the <a
        href="configure.html#configuration-file">configuration
        file</a>.  The example below sets the threshold to the
        default value of 0.4:
        <pre class="sourcecode">[{rabbit, [{vm_memory_high_watermark, 0.4}]}].</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        The default value of 0.4 stands for 40% of installed RAM or
        40% of available virtual address space, whichever is
        smaller. E.g. on a 32-bit platform, if you have 4GB of RAM
        installed, 40% of 4GB is 1.6GB, but 32-bit Windows normally
        limits processes to 2GB, so the threshold is actually to 40%
        of 2GB (which is 820MB).
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, the memory threshold can be adjusted by setting
	an absolute limit of RAM used by the node. The example below sets
	the threshold to 1073741824 bytes (1024 MB):
        <pre class="sourcecode">[{rabbit, [{vm_memory_high_watermark, {absolute, 1073741824}}]}].</pre>
        Same example, but using memory units:
        <pre class="sourcecode">[{rabbit, [{vm_memory_high_watermark, {absolute, "1024MiB"}}]}].</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
	If the absolute limit is larger than the installed RAM or available virtual
	address space, the threshold is set to whichever limit is smaller.
      </p>

      <p>
        The memory limit is appended to the
        <b>RABBITMQ_NODENAME</b>.log file when the RabbitMQ server
        starts:
        <pre class="sourcecode">
=INFO REPORT==== 29-Oct-2009::15:43:27 ===
Memory limit set to 2048MB.</pre>
        The memory limit may also be queried using the
        <code>rabbitmqctl status</code> command.
      </p>

      <p>
        The threshold can be changed while the broker is running
        using the <code>rabbitmqctl set_vm_memory_high_watermark
        <em>fraction</em></code> command or
	<code>rabbitmqctl set_vm_memory_high_watermark absolute
        <em>memory_limit</em></code> command. 
        Memory units can also be used in this command.
        This command will take effect
        until the broker shuts down. The corresponding configuration
        setting should also be changed when the effects should survive
        a broker restart. The memory limit may change on systems with
        hot-swappable RAM when this command is executed without altering
        the threshold, due to the fact that the total amount of system
        RAM is queried.
      </p>

      <h3>Disabling all publishing</h3>
      <p>
        A value of <code>0</code> makes the memory alarm go off
        immediately and thus disables all publishing (this may be
        useful if you wish to disable publishing globally);
        use <code>rabbitmqctl set_vm_memory_high_watermark
        0</code>.

    <doc:section name="address-space">
      <doc:heading>Limited Address Space</doc:heading>
      <p>
        When running RabbitMQ inside a 32 bit Erlang VM in a 64 bit
        OS (or a 32 bit OS with PAE), the addressable memory is
        limited. The server will detect this and log a message like:
      </p>

      <pre class="sourcecode">=WARNING REPORT==== 19-Dec-2013::11:27:13 ===
Only 2048MB of 12037MB memory usable due to limited address space.
Crashes due to memory exhaustion are possible - see
http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#address-space</pre>

      <p>
        The memory alarm system is not perfect. While stopping publishing
        will usually prevent any further memory from being used, it is quite
        possible for other things to continue to increase memory
        use. Normally when this happens and the physical memory is exhausted
        the OS will start to swap. But when running with a limited address
        space, running over the limit will cause the VM to crash.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is therefore strongly recommended that when running on a 64 bit
        OS you use a 64 bit Erlang VM.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="memsup-paging">
      <doc:heading>Configuring the Paging Threshold</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Before the broker hits the high watermark and blocks
        publishers, it will attempt to free up memory by instructing
        queues to page their contents out to disc. Both persistent
        and transient messages will be paged out (the persistent
        messages will already be on disc but will be evicted from
        memory).
      </p>
      <p>
        By default this starts to happen when the broker is 50% of
        the way to the high watermark (i.e. with a default high
        watermark of 0.4, this is when 20% of memory is used). To
        change this value, modify
        the <code>vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio</code>
        configuration from its default value
        of <code>0.5</code>. For example:
      </p>
      <pre class="sourcecode">[{rabbit, [{vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio, 0.75},
         {vm_memory_high_watermark, 0.4}]}].</pre>
      <p>
        The above configuration starts paging at 30% of memory used, and
        blocks publishers at 40%.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible to
        set <code>vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio</code> to a
        greater value than <code>1.0</code>. In this case queues
        will not page their contents to disc. If this causes the memory alarm
        to go off, then producers will be blocked as explained above.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="memsup-unrecognised-platforms">
      <doc:heading>Unrecognised platforms</doc:heading>
      <p>
        If the RabbitMQ server is unable to recognise your system,
        it will append a warning to the
        <b>RABBITMQ_NODENAME</b>.log file. It then assumes than
        1GB of RAM is installed:
        <pre class="sourcecode">
=WARNING REPORT==== 29-Oct-2009::17:23:44 ===
Unknown total memory size for your OS {unix,magic_homebrew_os}. Assuming memory size is 1024MB.</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case, the <code>vm_memory_high_watermark</code>
        configuration value is used to scale the assumed 1GB
        RAM. With the default value of
        <code>vm_memory_high_watermark</code> set to 0.4,
        RabbitMQ's memory threshold is set to 410MB, thus it will
        throttle producers whenever RabbitMQ is using more than
        410MB memory. Thus when RabbitMQ can't recognize your
        platform, if you actually have 8GB RAM installed and you
        want RabbitMQ to throttle producers when the server is using
        above 3GB, set <code>vm_memory_high_watermark</code> to 3.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is advised you do not set the threshold above 50% of your
        installed RAM.

  <doc:heading>Managing the Broker</doc:heading>
  <p>
    To stop the broker or check its status, use
    <code>rabbitmqctl.bat</code> in
    <code>sbin</code> (as an administrator).
  </p>

  <h4>Stopping the Node</h4>
  <p>
<pre class="lang-powershell">
rabbitmqctl.bat stop
</pre>
  </p>

  <h4>Checking Node Status</h4>
  <p>
<pre class="lang-powershell">
rabbitmqctl.bat status
</pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    See <a href="/cli.html">RabbitMQ CLI tools guide</a> and  <a href="man/rabbitmqctl.8.html">rabbitmqctl man page</a> for details.
  </p>

  <h3>Server Logs</h3>
  <p>
    Server logs are critically important in troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
    See <a href="/logging.html">Logging</a> and <a href="/relocate.html">File and Directory Location</a> guides
    to learn about log file location, log rotation and more.
  </p>

  <h3>Troubleshooting When Running as a Service</h3>
  <p>
    In the event that the Erlang VM crashes whilst RabbitMQ is running
    as a service, rather than writing the crash dump to the current
    directory (which doesn't make sense for a service) it is written
    to an <code>erl_crash.dump</code> file in the base directory of
    the RabbitMQ server (set by the <b>RABBITMQ_BASE</b> environment
    variable, defaulting
    to <code>%APPDATA%\%RABBITMQ_SERVICENAME%</code> -
    typically <code>%APPDATA%\RabbitMQ</code> otherwise).

    <title>Securing Cluster (Inter-node) and CLI Tool Communication with TLS (SSL)</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <doc:section name="intro">
        <p class="intro">Sometimes is desirable to make the Erlang
        nodes talk to each other using TLS (SSL), and thus make the whole RabbitMQ
        cluster communication via TLS. To achieve that we need to configure the
        Erlang distribution mechanism to use TLS. In this document we are
        going to review the steps to make this possible.</p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="how-to-linux">
        <doc:heading>Linux</doc:heading>
        <p>First we need to create the TLS certificate that's going to
        be used by the Erlang distribution mechanism. We assume you have done
        that already, otherwise follow the main <a href="/ssl.html">TLS guide</a>.
        Once we have our certificates ready we need to concatenate the server
        certificate and key into one file, for example, assuming we have the
        files <code>server_certificate.pem</code> and
        <code>server_key.pem</code> we can do the following:</p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
cat server_certificate.pem server_key.pem &gt; rabbit.pem
</pre>

        <p>
          Then we have to tell Erlang where to find the
          <code>ssl</code> library during startup. We can create a variable like
          this:
        </p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
# NOTE: these commands ensure that ERL_SSL_PATH is the first line in
# /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf and will preserve the existing
# contents of that file if it already exists

erl -noinput -eval 'io:format("ERL_SSL_PATH=~s~n", [filename:dirname(code:which(inet_tls_dist))])' -s init stop &gt; /tmp/ssl-path.txt
cat /tmp/ssl-path.txt /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf &gt; /tmp/new-rabbitmq-env.conf
mv -f /tmp/new-rabbitmq-env.conf /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf
</pre>

      <p>First we find where Erlang has the <code>inet_tls_dist</code> library, and then the
        variable <code>ERL_SSL_PATH</code> is set with the result from that command.</p>

        <p>By using the previous information now is time to craft the
        <code>SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS</code> environment variable
        so RabbitMQ is able to start Erlang using TLS for distribution. We do
        that by setting the <code>proto_dist</code> argument to
        <code>inet_tls</code> and then telling Erlang what certificate to use
        (in our case that's the <code>rabbit.pem</code> file we just
        created). Finally we set secure renegotiation to
        <code>true</code>. Here is the line that should be added to
        <code>/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf</code> following the
        <code>ERL_SSL_PATH</code> line that the above commands added.
        Please note that the double quotes <b>must</b> be present:</p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS="-pa $ERL_SSL_PATH \
-proto_dist inet_tls \
-ssl_dist_opt server_certfile /path/to/rabbit.pem \
-ssl_dist_opt server_secure_renegotiate true client_secure_renegotiate true"
</pre>

        <p>Once our initial ("seed") node has inter-node connection configured with
        TLS, CLI tools such as <code>rabbitmqctl</code> also must use TLS
        to talk to the node. This means we have to do what we just did for
        <code>SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS</code> but this time for
        the environment variable <code>CTL_ERL_ARGS</code>. Here is the complete
        <code>/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf</code> file:</p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
# NOTE: the following path is **system dependent** (will
#       change depending on Erlang version, distribution used
#       installation method used). Please double check it before
#       proceeding.
ERL_SSL_PATH="/usr/lib64/erlang/lib/ssl-8.2.4/ebin"

SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS="-pa $ERL_SSL_PATH \
-proto_dist inet_tls \
-ssl_dist_opt server_certfile /path/to/rabbit.pem \
-ssl_dist_opt server_secure_renegotiate true client_secure_renegotiate true"

CTL_ERL_ARGS="-pa $ERL_SSL_PATH \
-proto_dist inet_tls \
-ssl_dist_opt server_certfile /path/to/rabbit.pem \
-ssl_dist_opt server_secure_renegotiate true client_secure_renegotiate true"
</pre>

        <p>Now that we have this in place, it's just a matter of
        starting RabbitMQ as we usually do to get the Erlang distribution to
        use TLS for internode communication. Just like CLI tools, all other nodes in
        the cluster that want to join our initial node must have inter-node connection TLS
        configured using <code>SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS</code> in their
        <code>/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf</code> file.</p>

        <p>
          All nodes and CLI tools must use certificate/key pairs and
          TLS settings that allow inter-node TCP connections perform
          TLS handshake and peer verification successfully.  For
          example, certificate/key pairs used by other nodes and CLI
          tools must be signed by the same CA as the initial node or a
          different CA that is trusted on the initial node's machine.
          This is no different from how <a href="/ssl.html">client and plugin TLS connections</a>
          work.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is possible to reuse a single certificate/key pair for all nodes and CLI tools
          if it uses a wildcard Common Name, e.g. <code>*.rabbitmq.example.local</code> and
          all host names RabbitMQ nodes plus CLI tools are started on match the wildcard pattern.

        <doc:heading>Linux (Erlang 20.2 and later)</doc:heading>
        <p>Starting with <a href="http://www.erlang.org/news/116">version 20.2</a>,
          Erlang supports the <code>-ssl_dist_optfile</code>
          argument that allows configuring TLS for distributed Erlang in a file. This greatly simplifies
          the arguments passed on the command line itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a complete <code>/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf</code> file using this setting.
          Note that the name of the <code>-ssl_dist_optfile</code> file is not significant, it just
          must be saved in a location readable by the <code>rabbitmq</code> user:
        </p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
# NOTE: the following path is **system dependent**
ERL_SSL_PATH="/usr/lib64/erlang/lib/ssl-8.2.4/ebin"

SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS="-pa $ERL_SSL_PATH \
-proto_dist inet_tls \
-ssl_dist_optfile /etc/rabbitmq/ssl_dist.config

CTL_ERL_ARGS="-pa $ERL_SSL_PATH \
-proto_dist inet_tls \
-ssl_dist_optfile /etc/rabbitmq/ssl_dist.config
</pre>

        <p>
          Here is an example <code>/etc/rabbitmq/ssl_dist.config</code> file:
        </p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
[
  {server, [
    {cacertfile, "/full/path/to/ca_certificate.pem"},
    {certfile, "/full/path/to/server_certificate.pem"},
    {keyfile,  "/full/path/to/server_key.pem"},
    {secure_renegotiate, true},
    {verify, verify_peer},
    {fail_if_no_peer_cert, true}
  ]},
  {client, [
    {cacertfile, "/full/path/to/ca_certificate.pem"},
    {certfile, "/full/path/to/client_certificate.pem"},
    {keyfile, "/full/path/to/client_key.pem"},
    {secure_renegotiate, true},
    {verify, verify_peer},
    {fail_if_no_peer_cert, true}
  ]}
].
</pre>
        <p>
          The file contains many of the most common options enabled to fully validate certificates.
          These options are documented further in the Erlang/OTP documentation:
          <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/apps/ssl/ssl_distribution.html">Using TLS for Erlang Distribution</a>
          as well as in the <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/ssl.html">ssl library documentation</a>.
        </p>

      <doc:section name="how-to-macos">
        <doc:heading>MacOS</doc:heading>
        <p>If you are using the <a href="/install-standalone-mac.html#standalone-mac">MacOS standalone distribution</a>, then you need
        to add some extra arguments in order to run the <code>erl</code>
        command to find the path of Erlang's TLS library.  Assuming you are
        inside the folder where you installed the standalone release, the
        commands will look like these:</p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
echo erts-6.1/bin/erl -boot releases/3.4.3/start_clean \
-eval 'io:format("~p", [code:lib_dir(ssl, ebin)]),halt().' -noshell
"/path/to/erl/lib/ssl-5.3.5/ebin"
export ERL_SSL_PATH=/path/to/erl/lib/ssl-5.3.5/ebin
</pre>

        <p>
          The difference is that we need to specify the path to the
          <code>erl</code> executable and also provide a path to a boot file,
          which in our case is inside the releases folder of our standalone
          installation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you have ran the previous commands, then you can
          proceed to create the environment variables as explained above on the
          <a href="/clustering-ssl.html#how-to-linux">Linux section</a>

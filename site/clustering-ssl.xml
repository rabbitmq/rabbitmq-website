    <title>Securing Cluster (Inter-node) and CLI Tool Communication with TLS (SSL)</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <doc:section name="intro">
        <p class="intro">Sometimes is desirable to make the Erlang
        nodes talk to each other using TLS (SSL), and thus make the whole RabbitMQ
        cluster communication via TLS. To achieve that we need to make the
        Erlang distribution mechanism to use TLS. In this document we are
        going to review the steps to make this possible.</p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="how-to-linux">
        <doc:heading>Linux</doc:heading>
        <p>First we need to create the TLS certificate that's going to
        be used by the Erlang distribution mechanism. We assume you have done
        that already, otherwise follow the main <a href="/ssl.html">TLS guide</a>.
        Once we have our certificates ready we need to concatenate the server
        certificate and key into one file, for example, assuming we have the
        files <code>server_certificate.pem</code> and
        <code>server_key.pem</code> we can do the following:</p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
cat server_certificate.pem server_key.pem &gt; rabbit.pem
</pre>

        <p>Then we have to tell Erlang where to find the
        <code>ssl</code> library during startup. We can create a variable like
        this:</p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
echo `erl -eval 'io:format("~p", [code:lib_dir(ssl, ebin)]),halt().' -noshell`
"/path/to/erl/lib/ssl-5.3.5/ebin"
export ERL_SSL_PATH=/path/to/erl/lib/ssl-5.3.5/ebin
</pre>

        <p>There first we find where Erlang has the ssl library, and then the
          variable ERL_SSL_PATH is set with the result from the first command
          <em>without</em> the double quotes.</p>

        <p>By using the previous information now is time to craft the
        <code>$RABBITMQ_SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS</code> environment variable
        so RabbitMQ is able to start Erlang using TLS for distribution. We do
        that by setting the <code>proto_dist</code> argument to
        <code>inet_tls</code> and then telling Erlang what certificate to use
        (in our case that's the <code>rabbit.pem</code> file we just
        created). Finally we set secure renegotiation to
        <code>true</code>. Here's the whole command:</p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
export RABBITMQ_SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS=-pa ${ERL_SSL_PATH} \
-proto_dist inet_tls \
-ssl_dist_opt server_certfile /path/to/rabbit.pem \
-ssl_dist_opt server_secure_renegotiate true client_secure_renegotiate true
</pre>

        <p>Once our initial ("seed") node has inter-node connection configured with
        TLS, CLI tools such as
        <code>rabbitmqctl</code> also must use TLS
        to talk to the node. This
        means we have to do what we just did for
        <code>$RABBITMQ_SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS</code> but this time for
        the environment variable <code>RABBITMQ_CTL_ERL_ARGS</code>.</p>

        <p>Now that we have this in place, it's just a matter of
        starting RabbitMQ as we usually do to get the Erlang distribution to
        use TLS for internode communication. Just like CLI tools, all other nodes in
        the cluster that want to join our initial node must have inter-node connection TLS
        configured using <code>RABBITMQ_SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS</code> arguments.</p>

        <p>
          All nodes and CLI tools must use certificate/key pairs and
          TLS settings that allow inter-node TCP connections perform
          TLS handshake and peer verification successfully.  For
          example, certificate/key pairs used by other nodes and CLI
          tools must be signed by the same CA as the initial node or a
          different CA that is trusted on the initial node's machine.
          This is no different from how <a href="/ssl.html">client and plugin TLS connections</a>
          work.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is possible to reuse a single certificate/key pair for all nodes and CLI tools
          if it uses a wildcard Common Name, e.g. <code>*.rabbitmq.example.local</code> and
          all host names RabbitMQ nodes plus CLI tools are started on match the wildcard pattern.

      <doc:section name="how-to-osx">
        <doc:heading>OS X</doc:heading>
        <p>If you are using the OSX Standalone Release, then you need
        to add some extra arguments in order to run the <code>erl</code>
        command to find the path of Erlang's TLS library.  Assuming you are
        inside the folder where you installed the standalone release, the
        commands will look like these:</p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
echo erts-6.1/bin/erl -boot releases/3.4.3/start_clean \
-eval 'io:format("~p", [code:lib_dir(ssl, ebin)]),halt().' -noshell
"/path/to/erl/lib/ssl-5.3.5/ebin"
export ERL_SSL_PATH=/path/to/erl/lib/ssl-5.3.5/ebin
</pre>

        <p>The difference is that we need to specify the path to the
        <code>erl</code> executable and also provide a path to a boot file,
        which in our case is inside the releases folder of our standalone
        installation.</p>

        <p>Once you have ran the previous commands, then you can
        proceed to create the environment variables as explained above on the
        <a href="/clustering-ssl.html#how-to-linux">Linux section</a></p>

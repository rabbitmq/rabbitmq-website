      There are two circumstances under which RabbitMQ will stop
      reading from client network sockets, in order to prevent
      crashes. They are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When <a href="memory-use.html">memory use</a> goes above the
        configured limit.
      </li>
      <li>
        When disk space drops below the configured limit.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In both circumstances the server will temporarily <em>block</em>
      connections - the server will pause reading from the sockets of
      connected clients which publish messages. Connection
      heartbeat monitoring will be disabled too. All network
      connections will show in <code>rabbitmqctl</code> and the
      management plugin as either <code>blocking</code>, meaning they
      have not attempted to publish and can thus continue or
      <code>blocked</code>, meaning they have published and are now
      paused.
    </p>

    <p>
      When running RabbitMQ in a cluster, the memory and disk alarms
      are cluster-wide; if one node goes over the limit then all nodes
      will block connections.
    </p>

    <p>
      The intent here is to stop producers but let consumers continue
      unaffected. However, since AMQP permits producers and consumers
      to operate on the same channel, and on different channels of a
      single connection, this logic is necessarily imperfect. In
      practice that does not pose any problems for most applications
      since the throttling is observable merely as a
      delay. Nevertheless, other design considerations permitting, it
      is advisable to only use individual AMQP connections for either
      producing or consuming.

          When the server is close to using all the file descriptors
          that the OS has made available to it, it will refuse client
          connections altogether.
        </li>
        <li>
          When clients attempt to publish faster than the server can
          accept their messages, they go into <a
          href="flow-control.html">flow control</a>.

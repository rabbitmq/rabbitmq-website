    <title>Disk Alarms</title>

  <body>

    <p>
      RabbitMQ will block producers when free disk space drops
      below a certain limit. This is a good idea since even
      transient messages can be paged to disk at any time, and
      running out of disk space can cause the server to crash. By
      default RabbitMQ will block producers, and prevent
      memory-based messages from being paged to disk, when free disk
      space drops below 50MB. This will reduce but not eliminate the
      likelihood of a crash due to disk space being exhausted. In
      particular, if messages are being paged out rapidly it is
      possible to run out of disk space and crash in the time
      between two runs of the disk space monitor. A more
      conservative approach would therefore be to set the limit to
      the same as the amount of memory installed on the system
      (see the configuration <a href="#diskfreesup-usage">below</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Global flow control will be triggered if the amount of free disk
      space drops below a configured limit. The free space of the
      drive or partition that the broker database uses will be
      monitored at least every 10 seconds to determine whether the
      alarm should be raised or cleared.  Monitoring will start as
      soon as the broker starts up, causing an entry in the broker
      logfile:
      <pre class="sourcecode">
=INFO REPORT==== 23-Jun-2012::14:52:41 ===
Disk free limit set to 953MB</pre>
      Monitoring will be disabled on unrecognised platforms, causing an
      entry such as the one below:
      <pre class="sourcecode">
=WARNING REPORT==== 23-Jun-2012::15:45:29 ===
Disabling disk free space monitoring</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      When running RabbitMQ in a cluster, the disk alarm is
      cluster-wide; if one node goes under the limit then all nodes
      will block connections.
    </p>

    <p>
      RabbitMQ will periodically check the amount of free disk
      space. The frequency with which disk space is checked is related
      to the amount of space at the last check (in order to ensure
      that the disk alarm goes off in a timely manner when space is
      exhausted). Normally disk space is checked every 10 seconds, but
      as the limit is approached the frequency increases. When very
      near the limit RabbitMQ will check as frequently as 10 times per
      second. This may have some effect on system load.

      <doc:heading>Configuring the Disk Free Space Limit</doc:heading>
      <p>
        The disk free space limit is configured with
        the <code>disk_free_limit</code> setting. By default 50MB is
        required to be free on the database partition. (See the description of
        <a href="/relocate.html">file locations</a> for the default location).
        This configuration file sets the disk free space limit to 1GB:
        <pre class="sourcecode">[{rabbit, [{disk_free_limit, 1000000000}]}].</pre>
        It is also possible to set a free space limit relative to the RAM in the machine.
        This configuration file sets the disk free space limit to the same
        as the amount of RAM on the machine:
        <pre class="sourcecode">[{rabbit, [{disk_free_limit, {mem_relative, 1.0}}]}].</pre>

    <title>Disk Alarms</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <p>
      When free disk space drops below a configured limit (50MB by default), an
      alarm will be triggered and all producers will be blocked.

      The goal is to avoid fulling up the entire disk which will lead all
      write operations on the node to fail and can lead to RabbitMQ termination.

      To reduce the risk of filling up the disk, all incoming messages are
      blocked. Transient messages, which aren't persisted, are still paged out
      to disk when under memory pressure, and will use up the already limited
      disk space.

      If the disk alarm is set too low and messages are paged out rapidly, it
      is possible to run out of disk space and crash RabbitMQ in between disk
      space checks (at least 10 seconds apart). A more conservative approach
      would be to set the limit to the same as the amount of memory installed
      on the system (see the configuration <a
        href="#diskfreesup-usage">below</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      An alarm will be triggered if the amount of free disk space
      drops below a configured limit.

      The free space of the drive or partition that the broker database uses
      will be monitored at least every 10 seconds to determine whether the disk
      alarm should be raised or cleared.

      Monitoring will start as soon as the broker starts up, causing an entry
      in the broker logfile:
      <pre class="sourcecode">
=INFO REPORT==== 23-Jun-2012::14:52:41 ===
Disk free limit set to 953MB</pre>
      Monitoring will be disabled on unrecognised platforms, causing an
      entry such as the one below:
      <pre class="sourcecode">
=WARNING REPORT==== 23-Jun-2012::15:45:29 ===
Disabling disk free space monitoring</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      When running RabbitMQ in a cluster, the disk alarm is cluster-wide; if
      one node goes under the limit then all nodes will block incoming messages.
    </p>

    <p>
      RabbitMQ will periodically check the amount of free disk
      space. The frequency with which disk space is checked is related
      to the amount of space at the last check (in order to ensure
      that the disk alarm goes off in a timely manner when space is
      exhausted). Normally disk space is checked every 10 seconds, but
      as the limit is approached the frequency increases. When very
      near the limit RabbitMQ will check as frequently as 10 times per
      second. This may have some effect on system load.

      <doc:heading>Configuring the Disk Free Space Limit</doc:heading>
      <p>
        The disk free space limit is configured with
        the <code>disk_free_limit</code> setting. By default 50MB is
        required to be free on the database partition. (See the description of
        <a href="/relocate.html">file locations</a> for the default location).
        This configuration file sets the disk free space limit to 1GB:
        <pre class="sourcecode erlang">[{rabbit, [{disk_free_limit, 1000000000}]}].</pre>
        Or you can use memory units (kB, kiB, MB, MiB, GB, GiB etc.) like this:
        <pre class="sourcecode erlang">[{rabbit, [{disk_free_limit, "1GB"}]}].</pre>
        It is also possible to set a free space limit relative to the RAM in the machine.
        This configuration file sets the disk free space limit to the same
        as the amount of RAM on the machine:
        <pre class="sourcecode erlang">[{rabbit, [{disk_free_limit, {mem_relative, 1.0}}]}].</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        The limit can be changed while the broker is running
        using the <code>rabbitmqctl set_disk_free_limit <em>disk_limit</em></code> command
        or
        <code>rabbitmqctl set_disk_free_limit mem_relative <em>fraction</em></code> command. This command will take effect
        until the broker shuts down. The corresponding configuration
        setting should also be changed when the effects should survive
        a broker restart.

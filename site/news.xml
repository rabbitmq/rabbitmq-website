      <doc:title>Proudly part of Pivotal</doc:title>
      <doc:text>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ v3.1.0 is significant because it introduces an important
          <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2013/05/01/rabbitmq-3-1-0-in-images/">set of
          new features</a>, making Rabbit easier to use and manage.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eager synchronisation of mirror queue slaves</li>
          <li>Automatic cluster partition healing</li>
          <li>Improved statistics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          V3.1.0 has significance for another reason: it is the first release made
          under the banner of our new sponsor company, <a href="http://gopivotal.com/">Pivotal</a>.
          Pivotal launched earlier this year as a joint venture between VMware, EMC and with a
          strategic partnership with General Electric Global Software. Billed as "A New Platform
          for a New Era", the Pivotal platform will unite data, application, and cloud
          fabrics. The Rabbit team members are excited to be part of this bold new
          initiative driving open source innovation and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ will continue to be available under the open source
          <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/mpl.html">Mozilla Public License</a>
          or commercial terms. Commercial support, consulting and both self-paced and
          instructor-led training courses are still available worldwide.
          The <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/contact.html">rabbitmq-discuss mailing list</a>
          will continue to be the primary channel of communication about open-source RabbitMQ.
          The release cycle is not expected to change as a result of the change of ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
          We invite all customers to continue with us on the journey to become the most
          reliable, scalable and portable messaging system.

      <doc:title>RabbitMQ 2.8.4 release</doc:title>
      <doc:link>http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-announce/2012-June/000048.html</doc:link>
      <doc:text>
        <p>
          We've found an unpleasant bug in RabbitMQ 2.8.3 which can
          cause log rotation to trigger a state where the log file
          grows rapidly and without end, eventually exhausting all
          available disk space.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are running RabbitMQ 2.8.3 you are strongly advised
          to upgrade to 2.8.4 immediately and in the meantime do not
          invoke "rabbitmqctl rotate_logs". This applies particularly
          strongly to users of the RPM and .deb packages, since these
          are configured to rotate logs automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other versions of RabbitMQ are not affected by this bug.
        </p>
        <p>
          Binary and source distributions of the new release can
          be found on the
          <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">download page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage all users of earlier versions of RabbitMQ to
          upgrade to this latest release.
        </p>
        <p>
          As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback
          on this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
          enhancements in future releases. Mail us on the RabbitMQ discussion

              nodes</li>
              <li>better performance under high load and memory pressure</li>
              <li>source compatibility with the new Erlang R14B03 release</li>

            New features include:

              <li>tracing facility for debugging incoming and outgoing messages,
     (see <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/firehose.html">firehose</a>)</li>
              <li>improved inbound network performance</li>
              <li>improved routing performance</li>
              <li>new rabbitmqctl commands ('report', 'environment', and
                  'cluster_status')</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <doc:title>Spring AMQP Project 1.0 M1 release</doc:title>
        <doc:link>http://www.springsource.org/node/2715</doc:link>
        <doc:text>
          <p>The RabbitMQ team and SpringSource are pleased to announce the first milesone release of the Spring AMQP Project 1.0 M1.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-amqp">Spring AMQP</a> makes common Spring idoms
          available to developers who are building AMQP-based messaging solutions. For example, building a messaging
          application that uses RabbitMQ as broker will feel quite similar to building an application based on Spring's
          JMS support. The project consists of both Java and .NET versions.</p>
        <p>To learn more about the project, visit the
        <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-amqp">Spring AMQP homepage</a> for links to downloads, documentation, the forum and more.</p>

	  <p>The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.8.1.</p>

          <p>This release of RabbitMQ can now be compiled with Erlang

          Debian (unstable) users who build from source. Administration
          tools are now easier to use on MacPorts. Further enhancements
          include the ability to observe channel.flow events from the
          Java API and clustering usability improvements.</p>

	<doc:text>
	  <p>The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.8.0.</p>

          <p>This release introduces several APIs to extend Rabbit in
          a pluggable way, first with pluggable exchange types, and
          then with pluggable backing queues. Other improvements
          include optimisations for cross-node routing within a
          cluster, and more rigorous enforcement of channel.flow to
          ensure that Rabbit can stop producers who are failing to
          obey the instruction to stop sending messages to Rabbit when
          Rabbit comes under memory pressure.</p>

   Rabbit Technologies and Canonical announce teaming agreement

	<doc:link>http://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/RabbitMQ_CanonicalTeaming_PR.pdf</doc:link>

	<doc:text>
	<p>Rabbit Technologies Limited, the company behind RabbitMQ, today 
	announced the signing of a formal teaming agreement with Ubuntu sponsor 
	Canonical. The goal of the partnership is to promote open standards in
	the emerging cloud computing space.</p>

	<p>"We want to be sure our users can navigate safely into the cloud", said 
	Simon Wardley, software services manager for Canonical, "and we see this
	working according to three rules. Rule one is to build on their own 
	infrastructure. Rule two is moving between their infrastructure and an external 
	provider. Rule three is switching between providers. RabbitMQ provides an 
	important message bus in the cloud that enables applications to interoperate 
	without dependency upon a proprietary solution. It will play a significant 
	role in the future of cloud switching."</p>

   RabbitMQ provides VMware users with a reliable cloud bus based on open AMQP messaging
	</doc:title>

	<doc:link>http://www.vmware.com/appliances/</doc:link>

	<doc:text>
<p>We are delighted to be providing RabbitMQ open messaging to support the
VMware vCloud&#153;  Initiative, their customers and the growing cloud
ecosystem," Alexis Richardson, CEO, RabbitMQ.  "Customers want choice, and
RabbitMQ delivers choice by lowering the cost of scale, and by removing
lock-in.  RabbitMQ is the market leading implementation of AMQP, the
interoperable open business messaging protocol, and is distributed on most
major development platforms. Already businesses are using RabbitMQ to scale up
business-critical application functionality on multiple leading public and
private cloud infrastructures.  Our support for the VMware vCloud&#153; Initiative
is a natural extension.  RabbitMQ has an open source license making it ideal
for elastic deployments, and for integration in platforms such as Spring and
Ruby on Rails.</p>

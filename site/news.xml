        <doc:title>Spring AMQP Project 1.0 M1 release</doc:title>
        <doc:link>http://www.springsource.org/node/2715</doc:link>
        <doc:text>
          <p>The RabbitMQ team and SpringSource are pleased to announce the first milesone release of the Spring AMQP Project 1.0 M1.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-amqp">Spring AMQP</a> makes common Spring idoms
          available to developers who are building AMQP-based messaging solutions. For example, building a messaging
          application that uses RabbitMQ as broker will feel quite similar to building an application based on Spring's
          JMS support. The project consists of both Java and .NET versions.</p>
        <p>To learn more about the project, visit the
        <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-amqp">Spring AMQP homepage</a> for links to downloads, documentation, the forum and more.</p>

	</doc:title>

	<doc:text>
	  <p>The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.8.1.</p>

          <p>This release of RabbitMQ can now be compiled with Erlang
          R14A. This is expected to bring relief for MacPorts users and
          Debian (unstable) users who build from source. Administration
          tools are now easier to use on MacPorts. Further enhancements
          include the ability to observe channel.flow events from the
          Java API and clustering usability improvements.</p>

	  <p>For details see 
	  <a href="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-announce/2010-July/000027.html">the release notes</a>.</p>

	  <p>Binary and source distributions of the new release can be found in the 
	  <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">usual place</a>.</p>

	  <p>We recommend that all users of earlier versions of RabbitMQ upgrade to
	  this latest release.</p>

	  <p>As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback
	  on this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
	  enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion

	<doc:text>
	  <p>The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.8.0.</p>

          <p>This release introduces several APIs to extend Rabbit in
          a pluggable way, first with pluggable exchange types, and
          then with pluggable backing queues. Other improvements
          include optimisations for cross-node routing within a
          cluster, and more rigorous enforcement of channel.flow to
          ensure that Rabbit can stop producers who are failing to
          obey the instruction to stop sending messages to Rabbit when
          Rabbit comes under memory pressure.</p>

   Rabbit Technologies and Canonical announce teaming agreement
	</doc:title>

	<doc:link>http://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/RabbitMQ_CanonicalTeaming_PR.pdf</doc:link>

	<doc:text>
	<p>Rabbit Technologies Limited, the company behind RabbitMQ, today 
	announced the signing of a formal teaming agreement with Ubuntu sponsor 
	Canonical. The goal of the partnership is to promote open standards in
	the emerging cloud computing space.</p>

	<p>"We want to be sure our users can navigate safely into the cloud", said 
	Simon Wardley, software services manager for Canonical, "and we see this
	working according to three rules. Rule one is to build on their own 
	infrastructure. Rule two is moving between their infrastructure and an external 
	provider. Rule three is switching between providers. RabbitMQ provides an 
	important message bus in the cloud that enables applications to interoperate 
	without dependency upon a proprietary solution. It will play a significant 
	role in the future of cloud switching."</p>

   RabbitMQ provides VMware users with a reliable cloud bus based on open AMQP messaging
	</doc:title>

	<doc:link>http://www.vmware.com/appliances/</doc:link>

	<doc:text>
<p>We are delighted to be providing RabbitMQ open messaging to support the
VMware vCloud&#153;  Initiative, their customers and the growing cloud
ecosystem," Alexis Richardson, CEO, RabbitMQ.  "Customers want choice, and
RabbitMQ delivers choice by lowering the cost of scale, and by removing
lock-in.  RabbitMQ is the market leading implementation of AMQP, the
interoperable open business messaging protocol, and is distributed on most
major development platforms. Already businesses are using RabbitMQ to scale up
business-critical application functionality on multiple leading public and
private cloud infrastructures.  Our support for the VMware vCloud&#153; Initiative
is a natural extension.  RabbitMQ has an open source license making it ideal
for elastic deployments, and for integration in platforms such as Spring and
Ruby on Rails.</p>

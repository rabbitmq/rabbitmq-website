        <p>
          The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ
          3.5.3.
        </p>

        <p>
          This release fixes a number of bugs in 3.5.2 and earlier
          versions. In particular, two regressions introduced in 3.5.2
          which could prevent the broker from starting are now fixed.
        </p>

        <p>
          As <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rabbitmq-users/z41DX5ba0go/discussion">announced on the mailing-list</a>,
          there is a breakage in the Java client library API to
          <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/65">fix a bug</a>.
          Of course, if you are not impacted by this bug, you can
          safely continue to use a previous version of the library. We
          are discussing the possibility to release client libraries
          separately from the broker/plugins to have distinct
          versioning and avoid this problem in the future.

      <doc:link>release-notes/README-3.5.0.txt</doc:link>
      <doc:text>
        <p>
          The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ
          3.5.0.
        </p>

        <p>
          This release adds support for
          <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/priority.html">priority queues</a>
          which were available as a plugin before. Performance is improved;
          in particular messages smaller than configurable size are
          <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/persistence-conf.html">embedded in the queue index</a>
          to reduce I/O and memory consumption. Stability of clustering and
          autoheal partition handling is improved as well. A new
          <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#automatic-handling">pause_if_all_down</a>
          partition handling mode is added. The management web UI now shows
          many more I/O statistics.
        </p>

        <p>
          The .NET client receives many improvements leading to
          <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rabbitmq-users/sPSP3ulG6sg/discussion">backward-incompatible changes</a>
          to the <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/dotnet-api-guide.html">API</a>.
          In the future, NuGet will become the primary distribution method
          for the .NET client.
        </p>

        <p>
          This release also corrects a number of defects in the broker
          and plugins, as well as introducing many smaller new
          features and improvements.

      <doc:title>Security issues in RabbitMQ management plugin (3.4.2 or lower) [CVE-2015-0862]</doc:title>
      <doc:link>http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0862</doc:link>
      <doc:text>
        <p>
          Several security issues were found in the RabbitMQ management
          plugin. All versions of RabbitMQ up-to 3.4.2 included are
          affected. All issues are <strong>fixed in RabbitMQ 3.4.3</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The management plugin is a web interface which allows users
          to monitor the activity of a RabbitMQ cluster and perform
          administration tasks such as (but not limited to):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>adding, modifying or removing users;</li>
          <li>manage virtual hosts;</li>
          <li>manage resources (exchanges and queues);</li>
          <li>consume queued messages.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Some user-controllable content was not properly HTML-escaped
          before being presented to a user in the management web UI:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When a user unqueued a message from the management UI,
            message details (header names, arguments, etc.) were
            displayed unescaped.
            An attacker could publish a specially
            crafted message to add content or execute arbitrary Javascript
            code on behalf of a user, if this user unqueued the message
            from the management UI.
          </li>
          <li>
            When viewing policies, their name was displayed
            unescaped.
            An attacker could create a policy with a specially crafted
            name to add content or execute arbitrary Javascript code
            on behalf of a user who is viewing policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            When listing connected AMQP network clients, client details
            such as its version were displayed unescaped.
            An attacker could use a client with a specially crafted
            version field to add content or execute arbitrary Javascript
            code on behalf of a user who is viewing connected clients.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In all cases, the attacker needs a valid user account on the
          targetted RabbitMQ cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, some admin-controllable content was not properly
          escaped:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>user names;</li>
          <li>the cluster name.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Likewise, an attacker could add content or execute arbitrary
          Javascript code on behalf of a user using the management web UI.
          However, the attacker must be an administrator on the RabbitMQ
          cluster, thus a trusted user.
        </p>

        <p>
          No workaround is available, but RabbitMQ clusters with the
          management plugin disabled on all nodes are not affected.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strongly encourage you to upgrade to RabbitMQ 3.4.3.

      <doc:title>Proudly part of Pivotal</doc:title>
      <doc:text>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ v3.1.0 is significant because it introduces an important
          <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2013/05/01/rabbitmq-3-1-0-in-images/">set of
          new features</a>, making Rabbit easier to use and manage.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eager synchronisation of mirror queue slaves</li>
          <li>Automatic cluster partition healing</li>
          <li>Improved statistics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          V3.1.0 has significance for another reason: it is the first release made
          under the banner of our new sponsor company, <a href="http://pivotal.io/">Pivotal</a>.
          Pivotal launched earlier this year as a joint venture between VMware, EMC and with a
          strategic partnership with General Electric Global Software. Billed as "A New Platform
          for a New Era", the Pivotal platform will unite data, application, and cloud
          fabrics. The Rabbit team members are excited to be part of this bold new
          initiative driving open source innovation and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ will continue to be available under the open source
          <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/mpl.html">Mozilla Public License</a>
          or commercial terms. Commercial support, consulting and both self-paced and
          instructor-led training courses are still available worldwide.
          The <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/contact.html">rabbitmq-discuss mailing list</a>
          will continue to be the primary channel of communication about open-source RabbitMQ.
          The release cycle is not expected to change as a result of the change of ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
          We invite all customers to continue with us on the journey to become the most
          reliable, scalable and portable messaging system.

      <doc:title>RabbitMQ 2.8.4 release</doc:title>
      <doc:link>http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-announce/2012-June/000048.html</doc:link>
      <doc:text>
        <p>
          We've found an unpleasant bug in RabbitMQ 2.8.3 which can
          cause log rotation to trigger a state where the log file
          grows rapidly and without end, eventually exhausting all
          available disk space.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are running RabbitMQ 2.8.3 you are strongly advised
          to upgrade to 2.8.4 immediately and in the meantime do not
          invoke "rabbitmqctl rotate_logs". This applies particularly
          strongly to users of the RPM and .deb packages, since these
          are configured to rotate logs automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other versions of RabbitMQ are not affected by this bug.
        </p>

            of RabbitMQ 2.6.0.
          </p>

          <p>
            The highlight of this release is the introduction of
            active-active HA, with queues getting replicated
            across nodes in a cluster. There are many other
            improvements, particularly to the management and
            stomp plug-ins, as well as a number of bug
            fixes. See the release notes for more details.
          </p>

          <p>
            Binary and source distributions of the new release can
            be found in the <a
            href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">usual
            place</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We recommend that all users of earlier versions of
            RabbitMQ upgrade to this latest release.
          </p>

          <p>The RabbitMQ team and SpringSource are pleased to announce the first milesone release of the Spring AMQP Project 1.0 M1.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-amqp">Spring AMQP</a> makes common Spring idoms
          available to developers who are building AMQP-based messaging solutions. For example, building a messaging
          application that uses RabbitMQ as broker will feel quite similar to building an application based on Spring's
          JMS support. The project consists of both Java and .NET versions.</p>

      RabbitMQ 1.8.0 release

    <doc:text>
      <p>The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.8.0.</p>

          <p>This release introduces several APIs to extend Rabbit in
          a pluggable way, first with pluggable exchange types, and
          then with pluggable backing queues. Other improvements
          include optimisations for cross-node routing within a
          cluster, and more rigorous enforcement of channel.flow to
          ensure that Rabbit can stop producers who are failing to
          obey the instruction to stop sending messages to Rabbit when
          Rabbit comes under memory pressure.</p>

   Rabbit Technologies and Canonical announce teaming agreement
    </doc:title>

    <doc:link>http://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/RabbitMQ_CanonicalTeaming_PR.pdf</doc:link>

    <doc:text>
    <p>Rabbit Technologies Limited, the company behind RabbitMQ, today
    announced the signing of a formal teaming agreement with Ubuntu sponsor
    Canonical. The goal of the partnership is to promote open standards in
    the emerging cloud computing space.</p>

    <p>"We want to be sure our users can navigate safely into the cloud", said
    Simon Wardley, software services manager for Canonical, "and we see this
    working according to three rules. Rule one is to build on their own
    infrastructure. Rule two is moving between their infrastructure and an external
    provider. Rule three is switching between providers. RabbitMQ provides an
    important message bus in the cloud that enables applications to interoperate
    without dependency upon a proprietary solution. It will play a significant
    role in the future of cloud switching."</p>

    <doc:text>
<p>We are delighted to be providing RabbitMQ open messaging to support the
VMware vCloud&#153;  Initiative, their customers and the growing cloud
ecosystem," Alexis Richardson, CEO, RabbitMQ.  "Customers want choice, and
RabbitMQ delivers choice by lowering the cost of scale, and by removing
lock-in.  RabbitMQ is the market leading implementation of AMQP, the
interoperable open business messaging protocol, and is distributed on most

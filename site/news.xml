      <doc:title>PackageCloud Signing Key Migration</doc:title>
      <doc:link></doc:link>
      <doc:text>
        <p>
          PackageCloud is one of the services used by the RabbitMQ team to distribute packages.
          The service signs all packages uploaded to it with their own signing key. Recently PackageCloud
          started migrating to per-repository signing keys instead of a single master key.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 1st, 2018 (GMT) all repositories under the RabbitMQ account on PackageCloud will be switched to use the new
          signing keys.
          RabbitMQ users who install packages from PackageCloud must import the new signing keys
          before the migration. The recommended way of doing that is by re-running PackageCloud
          setup scripts (<a href="https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/install">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href="https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq/erlang/install">Erlang</a>).
          Signing keys can be downloaded and imported directly as well (<a href="https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/gpgkey">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href="https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq/erlang/gpgkey">Erlang</a>).
          If the new keys are not imported, package installation will start failing with a signature verification
          error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Services and tools that do not use PackageCloud (and thus rely on RabbitMQ's own <a href="/signatures.html">release signing key</a> for signing)
          are not affected by this transition.

          As announced previously on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users">RabbitMQ mailing list</a>,
          RabbitMQ 3.6.x release series will reach end of life on May 1st, 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          What this means:

          <ul>
            <li>3.6.x releases after May 2018 are highly unlikely</li>
            <li>Security patches may be provided depending on their severity through September 1st, 2018</li>
            <li>Bugs that only affect 3.6.x releases won't be addressed</li>
            <li>Most recent 3.6.x version packages will continue to be available from Bintray, Package Cloud and GitHub</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage all 3.6.x users to <a href="/upgrade.html">upgrade</a> to <a href="/changelog.html">the latest release</a>.
        </p>

     <doc:title>New OpenPGP keys</doc:title>
     <doc:text>
       <p>
         We are replacing our old OpenPGP keys we use to sign releases
         and nightlies with new stronger keys. The old keys were still
         DSA-1024 keys. The new ones are RSA-4096 keys. They are already
         available at the following locations:
       </p>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc">Release signing key</a></li>
         <li><a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-nightly-signing-key.asc">Nightly signing key</a></li>
       </ul>

       <p>
         You will find below the transition statement for each replaced
         keys. They are each signed with the appropriate old key and
         their corresponding new key. There are links so you can easily
         download the transition statements and verify them.
       </p>

       <p>
         For Deb and RPM packages users, we recommend you import the new
         keys as soon as possible, so the switch from the old to the new
         key is smooth. See the documentation
         <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html#apt">for Deb packages</a> and
         <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html">for RPM packages</a>
         for instructions to import it.

OpenPGP Key Transition Statement for RabbitMQ Release Signing Key

We have created a new OpenPGP key and will be transitioning away from
the old key. The old key has not been compromised and will continue
to be valid for some time, but we will sign release artifacts and
repositories with the new key going forward.

We would like this new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust.
This message is signed by both keys to certify the transition.  The new
and old keys are signed by each other.

The old key, which we are transitioning away from, is:

pub   dsa1024/0xF7B8CEA6056E8E56 2007-07-06 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = F783 72A0 6FF5 0C80 464F  C1B4 F7B8 CEA6 056E 8E56
uid                              RabbitMQ Release Signing Key &lt;info@rabbitmq.com&gt;

The new key, to which we are transitioning, is:

pub   rsa4096/0x6B73A36E6026DFCA 2016-05-17 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = 0A9A F211 5F46 87BD 2980  3A20 6B73 A36E 6026 DFCA
uid                              RabbitMQ Release Signing Key &lt;info@rabbitmq.com&gt;

The entire key may be downloaded from: http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc

To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

  gpg --recv-key 0x6B73A36E6026DFCA

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 0x6B73A36E6026DFCA

If you'd like any further verification or have any questions about the
transition please contact us directly.

          versions. In particular, two regressions introduced in 3.5.2
          which could prevent the broker from starting are now fixed.
        </p>

        <p>
          As <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rabbitmq-users/z41DX5ba0go/discussion">announced on the mailing-list</a>,
          there is a breakage in the Java client library API to
          <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/65">fix a bug</a>.
          Of course, if you are not impacted by this bug, you can
          safely continue to use a previous version of the library. We
          are discussing the possibility to release client libraries
          separately from the broker/plugins to have distinct
          versioning and avoid this problem in the future.

      <doc:text>
        <p>
          The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ
          3.5.0.
        </p>

        <p>
          This release adds support for
          <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/priority.html">priority queues</a>
          which were available as a plugin before. Performance is improved;
          in particular messages smaller than configurable size are
          <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/persistence-conf.html">embedded in the queue index</a>
          to reduce I/O and memory consumption. Stability of clustering and
          autoheal partition handling is improved as well. A new
          <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#automatic-handling">pause_if_all_down</a>
          partition handling mode is added. The management web UI now shows
          many more I/O statistics.
        </p>

        <p>
          The .NET client receives many improvements leading to
          <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rabbitmq-users/sPSP3ulG6sg/discussion">backward-incompatible changes</a>
          to the <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/dotnet-api-guide.html">API</a>.
          In the future, NuGet will become the primary distribution method
          for the .NET client.
        </p>

        <p>
          This release also corrects a number of defects in the broker
          and plugins, as well as introducing many smaller new
          features and improvements.

      <doc:title>Security issues in RabbitMQ management plugin (3.4.2 or lower) [CVE-2015-0862]</doc:title>
      <doc:link>http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0862</doc:link>
      <doc:text>
        <p>
          Several security issues were found in the RabbitMQ management
          plugin. All versions of RabbitMQ up-to 3.4.2 included are
          affected. All issues are <strong>fixed in RabbitMQ 3.4.3</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The management plugin is a web interface which allows users
          to monitor the activity of a RabbitMQ cluster and perform
          administration tasks such as (but not limited to):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>adding, modifying or removing users;</li>
          <li>manage virtual hosts;</li>
          <li>manage resources (exchanges and queues);</li>
          <li>consume queued messages.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Some user-controllable content was not properly HTML-escaped
          before being presented to a user in the management web UI:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When a user unqueued a message from the management UI,
            message details (header names, arguments, etc.) were
            displayed unescaped.
            An attacker could publish a specially
            crafted message to add content or execute arbitrary Javascript
            code on behalf of a user, if this user unqueued the message
            from the management UI.
          </li>
          <li>
            When viewing policies, their name was displayed
            unescaped.
            An attacker could create a policy with a specially crafted
            name to add content or execute arbitrary Javascript code
            on behalf of a user who is viewing policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            When listing connected AMQP network clients, client details
            such as its version were displayed unescaped.
            An attacker could use a client with a specially crafted
            version field to add content or execute arbitrary Javascript
            code on behalf of a user who is viewing connected clients.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In all cases, the attacker needs a valid user account on the
          targetted RabbitMQ cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, some admin-controllable content was not properly
          escaped:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>user names;</li>
          <li>the cluster name.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Likewise, an attacker could add content or execute arbitrary
          Javascript code on behalf of a user using the management web UI.
          However, the attacker must be an administrator on the RabbitMQ
          cluster, thus a trusted user.
        </p>

        <p>
          No workaround is available, but RabbitMQ clusters with the
          management plugin disabled on all nodes are not affected.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strongly encourage you to upgrade to RabbitMQ 3.4.3.

          The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ
          3.4.0.
        </p>

        <p>
          This release adds a fast reply-to mechanism for RPC clients,
          adds monitoring and limiting of queue length in bytes,
          allows plugins to be activated and deactivated without
          server restart, makes crashing queues recover from
          persistent data, and allows .net-based clients to reconnect
          automatically after network failure.
        </p>

        <p>
          This release also corrects a number of defects in the broker
          and plugins, as well as introducing many smaller new
          features and improvements.

      <doc:title>Proudly part of Pivotal</doc:title>
      <doc:text>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ v3.1.0 is significant because it introduces an important
          <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2013/05/01/rabbitmq-3-1-0-in-images/">set of
          new features</a>, making Rabbit easier to use and manage.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eager synchronisation of mirror queue mirrors</li>
          <li>Automatic cluster partition healing</li>
          <li>Improved statistics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          V3.1.0 has significance for another reason: it is the first release made
          under the banner of our new sponsor company, <a href="http://pivotal.io/">Pivotal</a>.
          Pivotal launched earlier this year as a joint venture between VMware, EMC and with a
          strategic partnership with General Electric Global Software. Billed as "A New Platform
          for a New Era", the Pivotal platform will unite data, application, and cloud
          fabrics. The Rabbit team members are excited to be part of this bold new
          initiative driving open source innovation and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ will continue to be available under the open source
          <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/mpl.html">Mozilla Public License</a>
          or commercial terms. Commercial support, consulting and both self-paced and
          instructor-led training courses are still available worldwide.
          The <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/contact.html">rabbitmq-discuss mailing list</a>
          will continue to be the primary channel of communication about open-source RabbitMQ.
          The release cycle is not expected to change as a result of the change of ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
          We invite all customers to continue with us on the journey to become the most
          reliable, scalable and portable messaging system.

      <doc:title>RabbitMQ 2.8.4 release</doc:title>
      <doc:link>http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-announce/2012-June/000048.html</doc:link>
      <doc:text>
        <p>
          We've found an unpleasant bug in RabbitMQ 2.8.3 which can
          cause log rotation to trigger a state where the log file
          grows rapidly and without end, eventually exhausting all
          available disk space.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are running RabbitMQ 2.8.3 you are strongly advised
          to upgrade to 2.8.4 immediately and in the meantime do not
          invoke "rabbitmqctl rotate_logs". This applies particularly
          strongly to users of the RPM and .deb packages, since these
          are configured to rotate logs automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other versions of RabbitMQ are not affected by this bug.

            are cluster upgrades.

          <p><a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-amqp">Spring AMQP</a> makes common Spring idoms
          available to developers who are building AMQP-based messaging solutions. For example, building a messaging

      RabbitMQ 1.8.0 release
    </doc:title>

    <doc:link>http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-announce/2010-June/000025.html</doc:link>

    <doc:text>
      <p>The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.8.0.</p>

          <p>This release introduces several APIs to extend Rabbit in
          a pluggable way, first with pluggable exchange types, and
          then with pluggable backing queues. Other improvements
          include optimisations for cross-node routing within a
          cluster, and more rigorous enforcement of channel.flow to
          ensure that Rabbit can stop producers who are failing to
          obey the instruction to stop sending messages to Rabbit when
          Rabbit comes under memory pressure.</p>

      <p>For details see
      <a href="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-announce/2010-June/000025.html">the release notes</a>.</p>

      <p>Binary and source distributions of the new release can be found in the
      <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">usual place</a>.</p>

      <p>We recommend that all users of earlier versions of RabbitMQ upgrade to
      this latest release.</p>

   Rabbit Technologies and Canonical announce teaming agreement
    </doc:title>

    <doc:link>http://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/RabbitMQ_CanonicalTeaming_PR.pdf</doc:link>

    <doc:text>
    <p>Rabbit Technologies Limited, the company behind RabbitMQ, today
    announced the signing of a formal teaming agreement with Ubuntu sponsor
    Canonical. The goal of the partnership is to promote open standards in
    the emerging cloud computing space.</p>

    <p>"We want to be sure our users can navigate safely into the cloud", said
    Simon Wardley, software services manager for Canonical, "and we see this
    working according to three rules. Rule one is to build on their own
    infrastructure. Rule two is moving between their infrastructure and an external
    provider. Rule three is switching between providers. RabbitMQ provides an
    important message bus in the cloud that enables applications to interoperate
    without dependency upon a proprietary solution. It will play a significant
    role in the future of cloud switching."</p>

   RabbitMQ provides VMware users with a reliable cloud bus based on open AMQP messaging
    </doc:title>

    <doc:link>http://www.vmware.com/appliances/</doc:link>

    <doc:text>
<p>We are delighted to be providing RabbitMQ open messaging to support the
VMware vCloud  Initiative, their customers and the growing cloud
ecosystem," Alexis Richardson, CEO, RabbitMQ.  "Customers want choice, and
RabbitMQ delivers choice by lowering the cost of scale, and by removing
lock-in.  RabbitMQ is the market leading implementation of AMQP, the
interoperable open business messaging protocol, and is distributed on most
major development platforms. Already businesses are using RabbitMQ to scale up
business-critical application functionality on multiple leading public and
private cloud infrastructures.  Our support for the VMware vCloud Initiative
is a natural extension.  RabbitMQ has an open source license making it ideal
for elastic deployments, and for integration in platforms such as Spring and
Ruby on Rails.</p>

    <p>The virtual appliance is available to download for free from the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/appliances/">VMware virtual appliance marketplace</a>.</p>

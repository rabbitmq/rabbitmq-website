    <title>Highly Available (Mirrored) Queues</title>
  </head>

      <doc:section name="overview">
        <p>
          By default, queues within a RabbitMQ cluster are located on
          a single node (the node on which they were first
          declared). This is in contrast to exchanges and bindings,
          which can always be considered to be on all nodes. Queues
          can optionally be made <i>mirrored</i> across multiple
          nodes. Each mirrored queue consists of one <i>master</i> and
          one or more <i>mirrors</i>, with the oldest mirror being
          promoted to the new master if the old master disappears for
          any reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Messages published to the queue are replicated to all
          mirrors. Consumers are connected to the master regardless of
          which node they connect to, with mirrors dropping messages
          that have been acknowledged at the master. Queue mirroring
          therefore enhances availability, but does not distribute
          load across nodes (all participating nodes each do all the
          work).
        </p>
        <p>
          This solution requires a RabbitMQ cluster, which means that
          it will not cope seamlessly with network partitions within
          the cluster and, for that reason, is not recommended for use
          across a WAN (though of course, clients can still connect
          from as near and as far as needed).
        </p>
        <p>
          There are multiple terms commonly used to identify primary
          and secondary replicas in a distributed system. This guide
          typically uses "master" to refer to the primary replica of a
          queue and "mirror" for secondary replicas.  However, you
          will find "slave" used here in there. This is because
          RabbitMQ CLI tools historically have been using the term
          "slave" to refer to secondaries. Therefore both terms are
          currently used interchangeably but we'd like to eventually
          get rid of the legacy terminology.

        <doc:heading>How Mirroring is Configured</doc:heading>

        <p>
          Before we provide an example of how to enable mirroring we should take a look
          at how it had been done historically and what is the recommended way today.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to mandatory properties
          (e.g. <code>durable</code> or <code>exclusive</code>),
          queues in RabbitMQ have optional parameters (arguments),
          sometimes referred to as <code>x-arguments</code>. Those are
          provided by clients when they declare queues and control
          various optional queue features, such as mirroring or <a
          href="/ttl.html">TTL</a>. The x-arguments can be used to
          configure mirroring parameters but there's a better way.
        </p>
        <p>
          A more flexible, unobtrisuve, and manageable way of configuring x-arguments
          is via <a href="/parameters.html#policies">policies</a>. A policy matches
          one or more queues by name (using a regular expression pattern) and
          appends its definition (a map of optional arguments) to the x-arguments of the matching
          queues. In other words, it is possible to configure x-arguments for multiple queues
          at once with a policy, and update them all at once by updating policy definition.
          This is the most common and recommended way of configuring mirroring in modern
          RabbitMQ versions. Please see <a href="/parameters.html#policies">documentation on policies</a>
          for more information.
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="mirroring-arguments">
        <doc:heading>Queue Arguments that Control Mirroring</doc:heading>
        <p>
          As we've covered above, queues typically have mirroring enabled
          via <a href="parameters.html#policies">policy</a>. Policies
          can change at any time; it is valid to create a non-mirrored
          queue, and then make it mirrored at some later point (and
          vice versa). There is a difference between a non-mirrored
          queue and a mirrored queue which does not have any mirrors -
          the former lacks the extra mirroring infrastructure and will
          likely provide higher throughput.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should be aware of the behaviour
          of <a href="#unsynchronised-mirrors">adding mirrors to a
          queue</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To cause queues to become mirrored, you should create a
          policy which matches them and sets policy
          keys <code>ha-mode</code> and
          (optionally) <code>ha-params</code>. The following table
          explains the options for these keys:
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th><code>ha-mode</code></th>
            <th><code>ha-params</code></th>
            <th>Result</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>all</code></td>
            <td>(absent)</td>
            <td>
              Queue is mirrored across all nodes in the
              cluster. When a new node is added to the cluster, the
              queue will be mirrored to that node.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>exactly</code></td>
            <td><i>count</i></td>
            <td>
              Number of queue instances in the cluster.

              A <i>count</i> value of 1 means just the queue master, with no
              mirrors. If the node running the queue master becomes
              unavailable, the queue will become unavailable.

              A <i>count</i> value of 2 means 1 queue master and 1 queue
              mirror. If the node running the queue master becomes unavailable,
              the queue mirror will be automatically promoted to master. In
              conclusion: <code>NumberOfQueueMirrors = NumberOfNodes - 1</code>.

              If there are less than <i>count</i> nodes in the cluster, the
              queue is mirrored to all nodes. If there are more than
              <i>count</i> nodes in the cluster, and a node containing a mirror
              goes down, then a new mirror will be created on another node. Use
              of <code>exactly</code> mode with <a href="#cluster-shutdown">
                <code>"ha-promote-on-shutdown": "always"</code></a> can be
              dangerous since queues can migrate across a cluster and become
              unsynced as it is brought down.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>nodes</code></td>
            <td><i>node names</i></td>
            <td>
              Queue is mirrored to the nodes listed in <i>node
              names</i>. Node names are the Erlang node names as they
              appear in <code>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</code>; they
              usually have the form "<tt>rabbit@hostname</tt>". If
              any of those node names are not a part of the cluster,
              this does not constitute an error. If none of the nodes
              in the list are online at the time when the queue is
              declared then the queue will be created on the node that
              the declaring client is connected to.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          Whenever the HA policy for a queue changes it will endeavour
          to keep its existing mirrors as far as this fits with the new
          policy.
        </p>

        <h3 id="replication-factor">To How Many Nodes to Mirror?</h3>
        <p>
          Note that mirroring to all queues is the most conservative option
          and is unnecessary in many cases. For clusters of 3 and more nodes
          it is recommended to mirror to a quorum (the majority) of nodes,
          e.g. 2 nodes in a 3 node cluster or 3 nodes in a 5 node cluster.
          Since some data can be inherently transient or very time sensitive,
          it can be perfectly reasonable to use a lower number of mirrors
          for some queues (or even not use any mirroring).
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="master-migration-data-locality">
        <doc:heading>Queue Masters, Master Migration, Data Locality</doc:heading>

        <h3 id="queue-master-location">Queue Master Location</h3>
        <p>
          Every queue in RabbitMQ has a home node. That node is called
          <em>queue master</em>. All queue operations go through the master
          first and then are replicated to mirrors. This is necessary to
          guarantee FIFO ordering of messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Queue masters can be distributed between nodes using several
          strategies. Which strategy is used is controlled in three ways,
          namely, using the <code>x-queue-master-locator</code> queue
          declare argument, setting the <code>queue-master-locator</code>
          policy key or by defining the <code>queue_master_locator</code>
          key in <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">
          <code>the configuration file</code></a>. Here are the possible
          strategies and how to set them:

          <ul>
            <li>Pick the node hosting the minimum number of masters:
            <code>min-masters</code></li>
            <li>Pick the node the client that declares the queue is
            connected to: <code>client-local</code></li>
            <li>Pick a random node: <code>random</code></li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>"nodes" Policy and Migrating Masters</h3>

        <p>
          Note that setting or modifying a "nodes" policy can cause
          the existing master to go away if it is not listed in the
          new policy. In order to prevent message loss, RabbitMQ will
          keep the existing master around until at least one other
          mirror has synchronised (even if this is a long
          time). However, once synchronisation has occurred things will
          proceed just as if the node had failed: consumers will be
          disconnected from the master and will need to reconnect.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a queue is on <code>[A B]</code>
          (with <code>A</code> the master), and you give it
          a <code>nodes</code> policy telling it to be on
          <code>[C D]</code>, it will initially end up on
          <code>[A C D]</code>. As soon as the queue synchronises on its new
          mirrors <code>[C D]</code>, the master on <code>A</code>
          will shut down.
        </p>

        <h3>Exclusive Queues</h3>

        <p>
          Exclusive queues will be deleted when the connection that
          declared them is closed. For this reason, it is not useful
          for an exclusive queue to be mirrored (or durable for that
          matter) since when the node hosting it goes down, the
          connection will close and the queue will need to be deleted
          anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          For this reason, exclusive queues are never mirrored (even
          if they match a policy stating that they should be). They
          are also never durable (even if declared as such).
        </p>

        <doc:heading>Examples</doc:heading>

        <p>
          The following example declares a policy named <code>ha-all</code> which matches
          the queues whose names begin with
          "<code>ha.</code>" and configures mirroring to all nodes in the cluster (see <a href="#replication-factor">To How Many Nodes to Mirror?</a> above):

        <doc:heading>Mirrored Queue Implementation and Semantics</doc:heading>
        <p>
          As discussed, for each mirrored queue there is one
          <i>master</i> and several <i>mirrors</i>, each on a
          different node. The mirrors apply the operations that occur
          to the master in exactly the same order as the master and
          thus maintain the same state. All actions other than
          publishes go only to the master, and the master then
          broadcasts the effect of the actions to the mirrors. Thus
          clients consuming from a mirrored queue are in fact
          consuming from the master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should a mirror fail, there is little to be done other than
          some bookkeeping: the master remains the master and no
          client need take any action or be informed of the failure.
          Note that mirror failures may not be detected immediately and
          the interruption of the per-connection flow control mechanism
          can delay message publication. The details are described
          <a href="nettick.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the master fails, then one of the mirrors will be promoted to
          master as follows:
          <ol class="plain">
            <li>
              The longest running mirror is promoted to master, the assumption
              being that it is most likely to be fully synchronised with the
              master. If there is no mirror that is <a
                href="#unsynchronised-mirrors">synchronised</a> with the
              master, messages that only existed on master will be lost.
            </li>
            <li>
              The mirror considers all previous consumers to have been abruptly
              disconnected. It requeues all messages that have been delivered
              to clients but are pending acknowledgement. This can include
              messages for which a client has issued acknowledgements, say, if
              an acknowledgement was either lost on the wire before reaching the
              node hosting queue master, or it was lost when broadcast from the master to the
              mirrors. In either case, the new master has no choice but to
              requeue all messages that it has not seen acknowledgements for.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consumers that have requested to be notified when a queue fails
              over <a href="#cancellation">will be notified of cancellation</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              As a result of the requeuing, clients that re-consume from the
              queue <b>must</b> be aware that they are likely to subsequently
              receive messages that they have already received.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the chosen mirror becomes the master, no messages that are
              published to the mirrored queue during this time will be lost
              (barring subsequent failures on the promoted node).
              Messages published to a node that hosts queue mirror are routed
              to the queue master and then replicated to all mirrors. Should the master fail,
              the messages continue to be sent to the mirrors and will be added
              to the queue once the promotion of a mirror to the master
              completes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Messages published by clients using <a
                href="confirms.html">publisher confirms</a> will still be
              confirmed even if the master (or any mirrors) fail
              between the message being published and a confirmation received
              by the publisher. From the point of view of the publisher,
              publishing to a mirrored queue is no different from publishing to
              a non-mirrored one.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are consuming from a mirrored queue with
          <code>noAck=true</code> (i.e. the client is not sending message
          acknowledgements), then messages can be lost. This is no different
          from the norm of course: the broker considers a message
          <em>acknowledged</em> as soon as it has been sent to a
          <code>noAck=true</code> consumer. Should the client disconnect
          abruptly, the message may never be received. In the case of a
          mirrored queue, should the master die, messages that are in-flight on
          their way to <code>noAck=true</code> consumers may never be received
          by those clients, and will not be requeued by the new master. Because
          of the possibility that the consuming client is connected to a node
          that survives, the <a href="#cancellation">consumer cancellation
            notification</a> is useful to identify when such events may have
          occurred. Of course, in practise, if you care about not losing
          messages, then you are advised to consume with
          <code>noAck=false</code>.

            <a href="specification.html#tx">transactions</a>. The
            semantics chosen are that in the case of both confirms and
            transactions, the action spans all mirrors of the
            queue. So in the case of a transaction, a
            <code>tx.commit-ok</code> will only be returned to a
            client when the transaction has been applied across all
            mirrors of the queue. Equally, in the case of publisher
            confirms, a message will only be confirmed to the
            publisher when it has been accepted by all of the
            mirrors. It is correct to think of the semantics as being
            the same as a message being routed to multiple normal
            queues, and of a transaction with publications within
            that similarly are routed to multiple queues.

            publish when they receive credit from all mirrors of a

            knowledge of which messages have been sent to which

        <doc:heading>Unsynchronised Mirrors</doc:heading>
        <p>
          A node may join a cluster at any time. Depending on the
          configuration of a queue, when a node joins a cluster,
          queues may add a mirror on the new node. At this point, the
          new mirror will be empty: it will not contain any existing
          contents of the queue. Such a mirror will receive new
          messages published to the queue, and thus over time will
          accurately represent the tail of the mirrored queue. As
          messages are drained from the mirrored queue, the size of
          the head of the queue for which the new mirror is missing
          messages, will shrink until eventually the mirror's contents
          precisely match the master's contents. At this point, the
          mirror can be considered fully synchronised, but it is
          important to note that this has occurred because of actions
          of clients in terms of draining the pre-existing head of the
          queue.
        </p>
        <p>
          A newly added mirror provides no additional form of
          redundancy or availability of the queue's contents that
          existed before the mirror was added, unless the queue has
          been explicitly synchronised. Since the queue becomes
          unresponsive while explicit synchronisation is occurring, it
          is preferable to allow active queues from which messages are
          being drained to synchronise naturally, and only explicitly
          synchronise inactive queues.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can determine which mirrors are synchronised with the
          following rabbitmqctl invocation:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode bash">rabbitmqctl list_queues name slave_pids synchronised_slave_pids</pre>
        <p>
          You can manually synchronise a queue with:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode bash">rabbitmqctl sync_queue <i>name</i></pre>
        <p>
          And you can cancel synchronisation with:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode bash">rabbitmqctl cancel_sync_queue <i>name</i></pre>
        <p>
          These features are also available through the management plugin.
        </p>

        <doc:subsection name="start-stop">
          <doc:heading>Stopping nodes and synchronisation</doc:heading>
          <p>
            If you stop a RabbitMQ node which contains the master of a
            mirrored queue, some mirror on some other node will be
            promoted to the master (assuming there is a synchronised mirror;
            see <a href="#cluster-shutdown">below</a>). If you
            continue to stop nodes then you will reach a point where a
            mirrored queue has no more mirrors: it exists only on one
            node, which is now its master.  If the mirrored queue was
            declared <i>durable</i> then, if its last remaining node is
            shutdown, durable messages in the queue will survive the
            restart of that node. In general, as you restart other
            nodes, if they were previously part of a mirrored queue then
            they will rejoin the mirrored queue.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there is currently no way for a mirror to know
            whether or not its queue contents have diverged from the
            master to which it is rejoining (this could happen during a
            network partition, for example). As such, when a mirror
            rejoins a mirrored queue, it throws away any durable local
            contents it already has and starts empty. Its behaviour is
            at this point the same as if it were a <a
            href="#unsynchronised-mirrors">new node joining the
            cluster</a>.

        <doc:subsection name="cluster-shutdown">
          <doc:heading>Stopping Master Nodes with Only Unsynchronised Mirrors</doc:heading>
          <p>
            It's possible that when you shut down a master node that
            all available mirrors are unsynchronised. A common
            situation in which this can occur is rolling cluster
            upgrades. By default, RabbitMQ will refuse to fail over to
            an unsynchronised mirror on controlled master shutdown
            (i.e. explicit stop of the RabbitMQ service or shutdown of
            the OS) in order to avoid message loss; instead the entire
            queue will shut down as if the unsynchronised mirrors were
            not there. An uncontrolled master shutdown (i.e. server or
            node crash, or network outage) will still trigger a
            failover even to an unsynchronised mirror.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you would prefer to have master nodes fail over to
            unsynchronised mirrors in all circumstances (i.e. you would
            choose availability of the queue over avoiding message
            loss) then you can set the
            <code>ha-promote-on-shutdown</code> policy key to
            <code>always</code> rather than its default value of
            <code>when-synced</code>.

        <doc:subsection name="promotion-while-down">
          <doc:heading>Loss of a Master While All Mirrors are Stopped</doc:heading>
          <p>
            It is possible to lose the master for a queue while all
            mirrors for the queue are shut down. In normal operation
            the last node for a queue to shut down will become the
            master, and we want that node to still be the master when
            it starts again (since it may have received messages that
            no other mirror saw).
          </p>

          <p>
            However, when you invoke
            <code>rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node</code>, RabbitMQ will attempt to find
            a currently stopped mirror for each queue which has its
            master on the node we are forgetting, and "promote" that
            mirror to be the new master when it starts up again. If
            there is more than one candidate, the most recently
            stopped mirror will be chosen.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's important to understand that RabbitMQ can only
            promote <b>stopped</b> mirrors during
            <code>forget_cluster_node</code>, since any mirrors that
            are started again will clear out their contents as
            described at "<a href="#start-stop">stopping nodes and
            synchronisation</a>" above. Therefore when removing a lost
            master in a stopped cluster, you must invoke
            <code>rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node</code> <i>before</i>
            starting mirrors again.

        <doc:subsection name="batch-sync">
          <doc:heading>Batch Synchronization</doc:heading>

          <p>
            Since RabbitMQ 3.6.0, masters perform synchronisation in
            batches. Batch can be configured via the
            <code>ha-sync-batch-size</code> queue argument.  Earlier
            versions will will synchronise <code>1</code> message at a
            time by default.  By synchronising messages in batches,
            the synchronisation process can be sped up considerably.
          </p>

          <p>
            To choose the right value for
            <code>ha-sync-batch-size</code> you need to consider:
            <ul class="plain">
              <li>
                average message size
              </li>
              <li>
                network throughput between RabbitMQ nodes
              </li>
              <li>
                net_ticktime value
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you set <code>ha-sync-batch-size</code> to
            <code>50000</code> messages, and each message in the
            queue is 1KB, then each synchronisation message between nodes
            will be ~49MB. You need to make sure that your network
            between queue mirrors can accomodate this kind of traffic. If the
            network takes longer than <a href="nettick.html">net_ticktime</a>
            to send one batch of messages, then nodes in the cluster could
            think they are in the presence of a network partition.
          </p>

          <h3 id="eager-synchronisation">Configuring Synchronisation</h3>

          <p>
            Let's start with the most important aspect of queue
            synchronisation: <em>while a queue is being synchronised, all other
              queue operations will be blocked</em>. Depending on multiple
            factors, a queue might be blocked by synchronisation for many
            minutes or hours, and in extreme cases even days.
          </p>

          <p>
            Queue synchronisation can be configured as follows:

            <ul class="plain">
              <li>
                <code>ha-sync-mode: manual</code> - this is the default mode.
                A new queue mirror will not receive existing messages, it will
                only receive new messages. The new queue mirror will become an
                exact replica of the master over time, once consumers have
                drained messages that only exist on the master. If the master
                queue fails before all unsychronised messages are drained,
                those messages will be lost. You can fully synchronise a queue
                manually, refer to <a
                  href="#unsynchronised-mirrors">unsynchronised mirrors</a>
                section for details.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>ha-sync-mode: automatic</code> - a queue will
                automatically synchronise when a new mirror joins. It is worth
                reiterating that queue synchronisation is a blocking operation.
                If queues are small, or you have a fast network between
                RabbitMQ nodes and the <code>ha-sync-batch-size</code> was
                optimised, this is a good choice.

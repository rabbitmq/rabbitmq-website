      <doc:heading>What is Queue Mirroring</doc:heading>

      <p>
        By default, contents of a queue within a RabbitMQ cluster are located on
        a single node (the node on which the queue was
        declared). This is in contrast to exchanges and bindings,
        which can always be considered to be on all nodes. Queues
        can optionally be made <i>mirrored</i> across multiple
        nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each mirrored queue consists of one <i>master</i> and
        one or more <i>mirrors</i>. The master is hosted on one
        node commonly referred as the master node. Each queue has
        its own master node. All operations for a given queue are first applied
        on the queue's master node and then propagated to mirrors. This
        involves enqueueing publishes, delivering messages to consumers, tracking
        <a href="/confirms.html">acknowledgements from consumers</a> and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Queue mirroring implies <a href="/clustering.html">a cluster of nodes</a>.
        It is therefore not recommended for use
        across a WAN (though of course, clients can still connect
        from as near and as far as needed).
      </p>
      <p>
        Messages published to the queue are replicated to all
        mirrors. Consumers are connected to the master regardless of
        which node they connect to, with mirrors dropping messages
        that have been acknowledged at the master. Queue mirroring
        therefore enhances availability, but does not distribute
        load across nodes (all participating nodes each do all the
        work).
      </p>
      <p>
        If the node that hosts queue master fails, the oldest mirror will be
        promoted to the new master as long as it synchronised. <a href="#unsynchronised-mirrors">Unsynchronised mirrors</a>
        can be promoted, too, depending on queue mirroring parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are multiple terms commonly used to identify primary
        and secondary replicas in a distributed system. This guide
        typically uses "master" to refer to the primary replica of a
        queue and "mirror" for secondary replicas.  However, you
        will find "slave" used here and there. This is because
        RabbitMQ CLI tools historically have been using the term
        "slave" to refer to secondaries. Therefore both terms are
        currently used interchangeably but we'd like to eventually
        get rid of the legacy terminology.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="ways-to-configure">
      <doc:heading>How Mirroring is Configured</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Mirroring parameters are configured using <a href="/parameters.html#policies">policies</a>. A policy matches
        one or more queues by name (using a regular expression pattern) and
        contains a definition (a map of optional arguments) that are added to the total set of
        properties of the matching queues.
        Please see <a href="/parameters.html#policies">Runtime Parameters and Policies</a>
        for more information on policies.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="mirroring-arguments">
      <doc:heading>Queue Arguments that Control Mirroring</doc:heading>
      <p>
        As we've covered above, queues have mirroring enabled
        via <a href="parameters.html#policies">policy</a>. Policies
        can change at any time; it is valid to create a non-mirrored
        queue, and then make it mirrored at some later point (and
        vice versa). There is a difference between a non-mirrored
        queue and a mirrored queue which does not have any mirrors -
        the former lacks the extra mirroring infrastructure and will
        likely provide higher throughput.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be aware of the behaviour
        of <a href="#unsynchronised-mirrors">adding mirrors to a
        queue</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To cause queues to become mirrored, you need to create a
        policy which matches them and sets policy
        keys <code>ha-mode</code> and
        (optionally) <code>ha-params</code>. The following table
        explains the options for these keys:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th><code>ha-mode</code></th>
          <th><code>ha-params</code></th>
          <th>Result</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>exactly</code></td>
          <td><i>count</i></td>
          <td>
            Number of queue replicas (master plus mirrors) in the cluster.

            <p>
              A <i>count</i> value of 1 means just the queue master, with no
              mirrors. If the node running the queue master becomes
              unavailable, <a href="#non-mirrored-queue-behavior-on-node-failure">the behaviour depends on queue durability</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              A <i>count</i> value of 2 means 1 queue master and 1 queue
              mirror. If the node running the queue master becomes unavailable,
              the queue mirror will be automatically promoted to master. In
              conclusion: <code>NumberOfQueueMirrors = NumberOfNodes - 1</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
              If there are fewer than <i>count</i> nodes in the cluster, the
              queue is mirrored to all nodes. If there are more than
              <i>count</i> nodes in the cluster, and a node containing a mirror
              goes down, then a new mirror will be created on another node. Use
              of <code>exactly</code> mode with <a href="#cluster-shutdown">
                <code>"ha-promote-on-shutdown": "always"</code></a> can be
              dangerous since queues can migrate across a cluster and become
              unsynced as it is brought down.
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>all</code></td>
          <td>(none)</td>
          <td>
              Queue is mirrored across all nodes in the
              cluster. When a new node is added to the cluster, the
              queue will be mirrored to that node.

            <p>
              This setting is very
              conservative, mirroring to a quorum (N/2 + 1) of cluster nodes
              is recommended instead. Mirroring to all nodes will put additional
              strain on all cluster nodes, including network I/O, disk I/O and
              disk space usage.
            </p>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>nodes</code></td>
          <td><i>node names</i></td>
          <td>
              Queue is mirrored to the nodes listed in <i>node
              names</i>. Node names are the Erlang node names as they
              appear in <code>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</code>; they
              usually have the form "<tt>rabbit@hostname</tt>".
            <p>
              If any of those node names are not a part of the cluster,
              this does not constitute an error. If none of the nodes
              in the list are online at the time when the queue is
              declared then the queue will be created on the node that
              the declaring client is connected to.
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        Whenever the HA policy for a queue changes it will endeavour
        to keep its existing mirrors as far as this fits with the new
        policy.

      <p>
        Mirroring parameters are configured using <a href="/parameters.html#policies">policies</a>. A policy matches
        one or more queues by name (using a regular expression pattern) and

    <doc:section name="how-to-check-i-a-queue-is-mirrored">
      <doc:heading>How to Check if a Queue is Mirrored?</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Mirrored queues will have a policy name and the number of additional replicas (mirrors)
        next to it on the queue page in the <a href="/management.html">management UI</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below is an example of a queue named <code>two.replicas</code> which has a master
        and a mirror:

        <img class="screenshot" src="img/mirroring/queue_mirroring_indicators_management_ui_row_only.png" alt="Mirrored queue indicators in management UI" title="Mirrored queue indicators in management UI" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Master node for the queue and its online mirror(s), if any, will be listed on the queue page:

        <img class="screenshot" src="img/mirroring/queue_mirroring_one_mirror_present.png" alt="Mirrored queue details on individual queue page" title="Mirrored queue details on individual queue page" />
      </p>

      <p>
        If the queue page does not list any mirrors, the queue is not mirrored (or has only one mirror which
        is not online):

        <img class="screenshot" src="img/mirroring/queue_mirroring_no_mirrors.png" alt="Non-mirrored queue details on individual queue page" title="Non-mirrored queue details on individual queue page" />
      </p>

      <p>
        When a new queue mirror is added, the event is logged:

<pre class="sourcecode">
2018-03-01 07:26:33.121 [info] &lt;0.1360.0&gt; Mirrored queue 'two.replicas' in vhost '/': Adding mirror on node hare@warp10: &lt;37324.1148.0&gt;
</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        It is possible to list queue master and mirrors using <code>rabbitmqctl list_queues</code>. In this
        example we also display queue policy since it's highly relevant:

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
rabbitmqctl list_queues name policy pid slave_pids

# =&gt; Timeout: 60.0 seconds ...
# =&gt; Listing queues for vhost / ...
# =&gt; two.replicas ha-two &lt;hare@warp10.1.2223.0&gt; [&lt;rabbit@warp10.3.1360.0&gt;]
</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        If a queue that's expected to be mirroring is not, this usually means that its name
        doesn't match that specified in the policy that controls mirroring or that another
        policy takes priority (and does not enable mirroring).
        See <a href="/parameters.html#policies">Runtime Parameters and Policies</a> to learn more.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="master-migration-data-locality">
      <doc:heading>Queue Masters, Master Migration, Data Locality</doc:heading>

      <h3 id="queue-master-location">Queue Master Location</h3>
      <p>
        Every queue in RabbitMQ has a home node. That node is called
        <em>queue master</em>. All queue operations go through the master
        first and then are replicated to mirrors. This is necessary to
        guarantee FIFO ordering of messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Queue masters can be distributed between nodes using several
        strategies. Which strategy is used is controlled in three ways,
        namely, using the <code>x-queue-master-locator</code> queue
        declare argument, setting the <code>queue-master-locator</code>
        policy key or by defining the <code>queue_master_locator</code>
        key in <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">
        <code>the configuration file</code></a>. Here are the possible
        strategies and how to set them:

        <ul>
          <li>Pick the node hosting the minimum number of <em>bound</em> masters:
          <code>min-masters</code></li>
          <li>Pick the node the client that declares the queue is
          connected to: <code>client-local</code></li>
          <li>Pick a random node: <code>random</code></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>"nodes" Policy and Migrating Masters</h3>

      <p>
        Note that setting or modifying a "nodes" policy can cause
        the existing master to go away if it is not listed in the
        new policy. In order to prevent message loss, RabbitMQ will
        keep the existing master around until at least one other
        mirror has synchronised (even if this is a long
        time). However, once synchronisation has occurred things will
        proceed just as if the node had failed: consumers will be
        disconnected from the master and will need to reconnect.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if a queue is on <code>[A B]</code>
        (with <code>A</code> the master), and you give it
        a <code>nodes</code> policy telling it to be on
        <code>[C D]</code>, it will initially end up on
        <code>[A C D]</code>. As soon as the queue synchronises on its new
        mirrors <code>[C D]</code>, the master on <code>A</code>
        will shut down.
      </p>

      <h3>Mirroring of Exclusive Queues</h3>

      <p>
        Exclusive queues will be deleted when the connection that
        declared them is closed. For this reason, it is not useful
        for an exclusive queue to be mirrored (or durable for that
        matter) since when the node hosting it goes down, the
        connection will close and the queue will need to be deleted
        anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this reason, exclusive queues are never mirrored (even
        if they match a policy stating that they should be). They
        are also never durable (even if declared as such).
      </p>
    </doc:section>


    <doc:section name="non-mirrored-queue-behavior-on-node-failure">
      <doc:heading>Non-mirrored Queue Behavior in a Cluster</doc:heading>

      <p>
        This guide focuses on mirrored queues, however, it is important
        to briefly explain how non-mirrored queues behave in a cluster in contrast
        with mirrored ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        If master node of a queue (the node running queue master) is available,
        all queue operations (e.g. declaration, binding and consumer management, message routing
        to the queue) can be performed on any node. Cluster nodes will route
        operations to the master node transparently to the clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        If master node of a queue
        becomes unavailable, the behaviour of a non-mirrored queue
        depends on its durability. A durable queue will become
        unavailable until the node comes back. A non-durable one will
        be migrated to a different node (note: since it's a
        non-mirrored queue, it will be empty after the migration).
        All operations on a durable queue with unavailable master node
        will fail with a message in server logs that looks like this:

        <pre class="">
operation queue.declare caused a channel exception not_found: home node 'rabbit@hostname' of durable queue 'queue-name' in vhost '/' is down or inaccessible
        </pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        In a way this difference in behavior allows developers to
        emphasize consistency or availability for a non-mirrored
        queue.

      <doc:heading>Mirrored Queue Implementation and Semantics</doc:heading>
      <p>
        As discussed, for each mirrored queue there is one
        <i>master</i> and several <i>mirrors</i>, each on a
        different node. The mirrors apply the operations that occur
        to the master in exactly the same order as the master and
        thus maintain the same state. All actions other than
        publishes go only to the master, and the master then
        broadcasts the effect of the actions to the mirrors. Thus
        clients consuming from a mirrored queue are in fact
        consuming from the master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should a mirror fail, there is little to be done other than
        some bookkeeping: the master remains the master and no
        client need take any action or be informed of the failure.
        Note that mirror failures may not be detected immediately and
        the interruption of the per-connection flow control mechanism
        can delay message publication. The details are described
        <a href="nettick.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the master fails, then one of the mirrors will be promoted to
        master as follows:
        <ol class="plain">
          <li>
            The longest running mirror is promoted to master, the assumption
            being that it is most likely to be fully synchronised with the
            master. If there is no mirror that is <a
              href="#unsynchronised-mirrors">synchronised</a> with the
            master, messages that only existed on master will be lost.
          </li>
          <li>
            The mirror considers all previous consumers to have been abruptly
            disconnected. It requeues all messages that have been delivered
            to clients but are pending acknowledgement. This can include
            messages for which a client has issued acknowledgements, say, if
            an acknowledgement was either lost on the wire before reaching the
            node hosting queue master, or it was lost when broadcast from the master to the
            mirrors. In either case, the new master has no choice but to
            requeue all messages that it has not seen acknowledgements for.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consumers that have requested to be notified when a queue fails
            over <a href="#cancellation">will be notified of cancellation</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a result of the requeuing, clients that re-consume from the
            queue <b>must</b> be aware that they are likely to subsequently
            receive messages that they have already received.
          </li>
          <li>
            As the chosen mirror becomes the master, no messages that are
            published to the mirrored queue during this time will be lost
            (barring subsequent failures on the promoted node).
            Messages published to a node that hosts queue mirror are routed
            to the queue master and then replicated to all mirrors. Should the master fail,
            the messages continue to be sent to the mirrors and will be added
            to the queue once the promotion of a mirror to the master
            completes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Messages published by clients using <a
              href="confirms.html">publisher confirms</a> will still be
            confirmed even if the master (or any mirrors) fail
            between the message being published and a confirmation received
            by the publisher. From the point of view of the publisher,
            publishing to a mirrored queue is no different from publishing to
            a non-mirrored one.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are consuming from a mirrored queue with
        <code>noAck=true</code> (i.e. the client is not sending message
        acknowledgements), then messages can be lost. This is no different
        from the norm of course: the broker considers a message
        <em>acknowledged</em> as soon as it has been sent to a
        <code>noAck=true</code> consumer. Should the client disconnect
        abruptly, the message may never be received. In the case of a
        mirrored queue, should the master die, messages that are in-flight on
        their way to <code>noAck=true</code> consumers may never be received
        by those clients, and will not be requeued by the new master. Because
        of the possibility that the consuming client is connected to a node
        that survives, the <a href="#cancellation">consumer cancellation
          notification</a> is useful to identify when such events may have
        occurred. Of course, in practise, if you care about not losing
        messages, then you are advised to consume with
        <code>noAck=false</code>.

        <doc:heading>Publisher Confirms and Transactions</doc:heading>
        <p>
          Mirrored queues support both <a
          href="confirms.html">publisher confirms</a> and
          <a href="specification.html#tx">transactions</a>. The
          semantics chosen are that in the case of both confirms and
          transactions, the action spans all mirrors of the
          queue. So in the case of a transaction, a
          <code>tx.commit-ok</code> will only be returned to a
          client when the transaction has been applied across all
          mirrors of the queue. Equally, in the case of publisher
          confirms, a message will only be confirmed to the
          publisher when it has been accepted by all of the
          mirrors. It is correct to think of the semantics as being
          the same as a message being routed to multiple normal
          queues, and of a transaction with publications within
          that similarly are routed to multiple queues.

          RabbitMQ uses a credit-based algorithm to <a

          message publication</a>.  Publishers are permitted to
          publish when they receive credit from all mirrors of a
          queue.  Credit in this context means permission to
          publish.  Mirrors that fail to issue credit can cause
          publishers to stall. Publishers will remain blocked until
          all mirrors issue credit or until the remaining nodes
          consider the mirror to be disconnected from the cluster.
          Erlang detects such disconnections by periodically sending

          Clients that are consuming from a mirrored queue may wish
          to know that the queue from which they have been consuming
          has failed over. When a mirrored queue fails over,
          knowledge of which messages have been sent to which
          consumer is lost, and therefore all unacknowledged
          messages are redelivered with the <code>redelivered</code>
          flag set. Consumers may wish to know this is going to
          happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          If so, they can consume with the argument
          <code>x-cancel-on-ha-failover</code> set to
          <code>true</code>. Their consuming will then be cancelled
          on failover and a <a href="consumer-cancel.html">consumer
          cancellation notification</a> sent. It is then the
          consumer's responsibility to reissue
          <code>basic.consume</code> to start consuming again.

        <p>
          A node may join a cluster at any time. Depending on the
          configuration of a queue, when a node joins a cluster,
          queues may add a mirror on the new node. At this point, the
          new mirror will be empty: it will not contain any existing
          contents of the queue. Such a mirror will receive new
          messages published to the queue, and thus over time will
          accurately represent the tail of the mirrored queue. As
          messages are drained from the mirrored queue, the size of
          the head of the queue for which the new mirror is missing
          messages, will shrink until eventually the mirror's contents
          precisely match the master's contents. At this point, the
          mirror can be considered fully synchronised, but it is
          important to note that this has occurred because of actions
          of clients in terms of draining the pre-existing head of the
          queue.
        </p>
        <p>
          A newly added mirror provides no additional form of
          redundancy or availability of the queue's contents that
          existed before the mirror was added, unless the queue has
          been explicitly synchronised. Since the queue becomes
          unresponsive while explicit synchronisation is occurring, it
          is preferable to allow active queues from which messages are
          being drained to synchronise naturally, and only explicitly
          synchronise inactive queues.
        </p>

        <p>
          When enabling automatic queue mirroring, consider the expected on disk
          data set of the queues involved. Queues with a sizeable data set
          (say, tens of gigabytes or more) will have to replicate it to
          the newly added mirror(s), which can put a significant load on
          cluster resources such as network bandwidth and disk I/O. This is
          a common scenario with lazy queues, for example.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can determine which mirrors are synchronised with the
          following rabbitmqctl invocation:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode bash">rabbitmqctl list_queues name slave_pids synchronised_slave_pids</pre>
        <p>
          You can manually synchronise a queue with:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode bash">rabbitmqctl sync_queue <i>name</i></pre>
        <p>
          And you can cancel synchronisation with:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode bash">rabbitmqctl cancel_sync_queue <i>name</i></pre>
        <p>
          These features are also available through the management plugin.
        </p>

        <doc:subsection name="start-stop">
          <doc:heading>Stopping nodes and synchronisation</doc:heading>
          <p>
            If you stop a RabbitMQ node which contains the master of a
            mirrored queue, some mirror on some other node will be
            promoted to the master (assuming there is a synchronised mirror;
            see <a href="#cluster-shutdown">below</a>). If you
            continue to stop nodes then you will reach a point where a
            mirrored queue has no more mirrors: it exists only on one
            node, which is now its master.  If the mirrored queue was
            declared <i>durable</i> then, if its last remaining node is
            shutdown, durable messages in the queue will survive the
            restart of that node. In general, as you restart other
            nodes, if they were previously part of a mirrored queue then
            they will rejoin the mirrored queue.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there is currently no way for a mirror to know
            whether or not its queue contents have diverged from the
            master to which it is rejoining (this could happen during a
            network partition, for example). As such, when a mirror
            rejoins a mirrored queue, it throws away any durable local
            contents it already has and starts empty. Its behaviour is
            at this point the same as if it were a <a
            href="#unsynchronised-mirrors">new node joining the
            cluster</a>.

        </doc:subsection>

        <doc:subsection name="cluster-shutdown">
          <doc:heading>Stopping Master Nodes with Only Unsynchronised Mirrors</doc:heading>
          <p>
            It's possible that when you shut down a master node that
            all available mirrors are unsynchronised. A common
            situation in which this can occur is rolling cluster
            upgrades. By default, RabbitMQ will refuse to fail over to
            an unsynchronised mirror on controlled master shutdown
            (i.e. explicit stop of the RabbitMQ service or shutdown of
            the OS) in order to avoid message loss; instead the entire
            queue will shut down as if the unsynchronised mirrors were
            not there. An uncontrolled master shutdown (i.e. server or
            node crash, or network outage) will still trigger a
            failover even to an unsynchronised mirror.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you would prefer to have master nodes fail over to
            unsynchronised mirrors in all circumstances (i.e. you would
            choose availability of the queue over avoiding message
            loss) then you can set the
            <code>ha-promote-on-shutdown</code> policy key to
            <code>always</code> rather than its default value of
            <code>when-synced</code>.

        <doc:subsection name="promotion-while-down">
          <doc:heading>Loss of a Master While All Mirrors are Stopped</doc:heading>
          <p>
            It is possible to lose the master for a queue while all
            mirrors for the queue are shut down. In normal operation
            the last node for a queue to shut down will become the
            master, and we want that node to still be the master when
            it starts again (since it may have received messages that
            no other mirror saw).
          </p>

          <p>
            However, when you invoke
            <code>rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node</code>, RabbitMQ will attempt to find
            a currently stopped mirror for each queue which has its
            master on the node we are forgetting, and "promote" that
            mirror to be the new master when it starts up again. If
            there is more than one candidate, the most recently
            stopped mirror will be chosen.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's important to understand that RabbitMQ can only
            promote <b>stopped</b> mirrors during
            <code>forget_cluster_node</code>, since any mirrors that
            are started again will clear out their contents as
            described at "<a href="#start-stop">stopping nodes and
            synchronisation</a>" above. Therefore when removing a lost
            master in a stopped cluster, you must invoke
            <code>rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node</code> <i>before</i>
            starting mirrors again.

          <doc:heading>Batch Synchronization</doc:heading>

          <p>
            Since RabbitMQ 3.6.0, masters perform synchronisation in
            batches. Batch can be configured via the
            <code>ha-sync-batch-size</code> queue argument.  Earlier
            versions will will synchronise <code>1</code> message at a
            time by default.  By synchronising messages in batches,
            the synchronisation process can be sped up considerably.
          </p>

          <p>
            To choose the right value for
            <code>ha-sync-batch-size</code> you need to consider:
            <ul class="plain">
              <li>
                average message size
              </li>
              <li>
                network throughput between RabbitMQ nodes
              </li>
              <li>
                net_ticktime value
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you set <code>ha-sync-batch-size</code> to
            <code>50000</code> messages, and each message in the
            queue is 1KB, then each synchronisation message between nodes
            will be ~49MB. You need to make sure that your network
            between queue mirrors can accomodate this kind of traffic. If the
            network takes longer than <a href="nettick.html">net_ticktime</a>
            to send one batch of messages, then nodes in the cluster could
            think they are in the presence of a network partition.
          </p>

          <h3 id="eager-synchronisation">Configuring Synchronisation</h3>

          <p>
            Let's start with the most important aspect of queue
            synchronisation: <em>while a queue is being synchronised, all other
              queue operations will be blocked</em>. Depending on multiple
            factors, a queue might be blocked by synchronisation for many

            Queue synchronisation can be configured as follows:

            <ul class="plain">
              <li>
                <code>ha-sync-mode: manual</code> - this is the default mode.
                A new queue mirror will not receive existing messages, it will
                only receive new messages. The new queue mirror will become an
                exact replica of the master over time, once consumers have
                drained messages that only exist on the master. If the master
                queue fails before all unsychronised messages are drained,
                those messages will be lost. You can fully synchronise a queue
                manually, refer to <a
                  href="#unsynchronised-mirrors">unsynchronised mirrors</a>
                section for details.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>ha-sync-mode: automatic</code> - a queue will
                automatically synchronise when a new mirror joins. It is worth
                reiterating that queue synchronisation is a blocking operation.
                If queues are small, or you have a fast network between
                RabbitMQ nodes and the <code>ha-sync-batch-size</code> was
                optimised, this is a good choice.

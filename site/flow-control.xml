    <title>Flow Control</title>

    <p>
      RabbitMQ will reduce the speed of connections which are
      publishing too quickly for queues to keep up. No configuration
      is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flow-controlled connection will show a state of
      <code>flow</code> in <code>rabbitmqctl</code>, management UI
      and HTTP API responses. This means the connection is experiencing
      blocking and unblocking several times a second, in order to keep the rate of
      message ingress at one that the rest of the server (e.g. queues those messages are route to)
      can handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, a connection which is in flow control should not see
      any difference from normal running; the <code>flow</code> state
      is there to inform the sysadmin that the publishing rate is
      restricted, but from the client's perspective it should just
      look like the network bandwidth to the server is lower than it
      actually is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other components than connections can be in the
      <code>flow</code> state. Channels, queues and other parts of the system
      can apply flow control that eventually propagates back to publishing connections.

      can be key limiting factors.

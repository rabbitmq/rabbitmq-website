# RabbitMQ tutorial - Routing SUPPRESS-RHS

## Routing
### (using the Java client)

<xi:include href="site/tutorials/tutorials-help.xml.inc"/>

In the [previous tutorial](tutorial-three-java.html) we built a
simple logging system. We were able to broadcast log messages to many
receivers.

In this tutorial we're going to add a feature to it - we're going to
make it possible to subscribe only to a subset of the messages. For
example, we will be able to direct only critical error messages to the
log file (to save disk space), while still being able to print all of
the log messages on the console.


Bindings
--------

In previous examples we were already creating bindings. You may recall
code like:

    :::java
    channel.queueBind(queueName, EXCHANGE_NAME, "");

A binding is a relationship between an exchange and a queue. This can
be simply read as: the queue is interested in messages from this
exchange.

Bindings can take an extra `routingKey` parameter. To avoid the
confusion with a `basic_publish` parameter we're going to call it a
`binding key`. This is how we could create a binding with a key:

    :::java
    channel.queueBind(queueName, EXCHANGE_NAME, "black");

The meaning of a binding key depends on the exchange type. The
`fanout` exchanges, which we used previously, simply ignored its
value.

Direct exchange
---------------

Our logging system from the previous tutorial broadcasts all messages
to all consumers. We want to extend that to allow filtering messages
based on their severity. For example we may want a program which
writes log messages to the disk to only receive critical errors, and
not waste disk space on warning or info log messages.

We were using a `fanout` exchange, which doesn't give us much
flexibility - it's only capable of mindless broadcasting.

We will use a `direct` exchange instead. The routing algorithm behind
a `direct` exchange is simple - a message goes to the queues whose
`binding key` exactly matches the `routing key` of the message.

To illustrate that, consider the following setup:

<div class="diagram">
  <img src="/img/tutorials/direct-exchange.png" height="170" />
  <div class="diagram_source">
    digraph {
      bgcolor=transparent;
      truecolor=true;
      rankdir=LR;
      node [style="filled"];
      //
      P [label="P", fillcolor="#00ffff"];
      subgraph cluster_X1 {
        label="type=direct";
	color=transparent;
        X [label="X", fillcolor="#3333CC"];
      };
      subgraph cluster_Q1 {
        label="Q1";
	color=transparent;
        Q1 [label="{||||}", fillcolor="red", shape="record"];
      };
      subgraph cluster_Q2 {
        label="Q2";
	color=transparent;
        Q2 [label="{||||}", fillcolor="red", shape="record"];
      };
      C1 [label=&lt;C&lt;font point-size="7"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&gt;, fillcolor="#33ccff"];
      C2 [label=&lt;C&lt;font point-size="7"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&gt;, fillcolor="#33ccff"];
      //
      P -&gt; X;
      X -&gt; Q1 [label="orange"];
      X -&gt; Q2 [label="black"];
      X -&gt; Q2 [label="green"];
      Q1 -&gt; C1;
      Q2 -&gt; C2;
    }
  </div>
</div>

In this setup, we can see the `direct` exchange `X` with two queues bound
to it. The first queue is bound with binding key `orange`, and the second
has two bindings, one with binding key `black` and the other one
with `green`.

In such a setup a message published to the exchange with a routing key
`orange` will be routed to queue `Q1`. Messages with a routing key of `black`
or `green` will go to `Q2`. All other messages will be discarded.


Multiple bindings
-----------------
<div class="diagram">
  <img src="/img/tutorials/direct-exchange-multiple.png" height="170" />
  <div class="diagram_source">
    digraph {
      bgcolor=transparent;
      truecolor=true;
      rankdir=LR;
      node [style="filled"];
      //
      P [label="P", fillcolor="#00ffff"];
      subgraph cluster_X1 {
        label="type=direct";
	color=transparent;
        X [label="X", fillcolor="#3333CC"];
      };
      subgraph cluster_Q1 {
        label="Q1";
	color=transparent;
        Q1 [label="{||||}", fillcolor="red", shape="record"];
      };
      subgraph cluster_Q2 {
        label="Q2";
	color=transparent;
        Q2 [label="{||||}", fillcolor="red", shape="record"];
      };
      C1 [label=&lt;C&lt;font point-size="7"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&gt;, fillcolor="#33ccff"];
      C2 [label=&lt;C&lt;font point-size="7"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&gt;, fillcolor="#33ccff"];
      //
      P -&gt; X;
      X -&gt; Q1 [label="black"];
      X -&gt; Q2 [label="black"];
      Q1 -&gt; C1;
      Q2 -&gt; C2;
    }
  </div>
</div>

It is perfectly legal to bind multiple queues with the same binding
key. In our example we could add a binding between `X` and `Q1` with
binding key `black`. In that case, the `direct` exchange will behave
like `fanout` and will broadcast the message to all the matching
queues. A message with routing key `black` will be delivered to both
`Q1` and `Q2`.


Emitting logs
-------------

We'll use this model for our logging system. Instead of `fanout` we'll
send messages to a `direct` exchange. We will supply the log severity as
a `routing key`. That way the receiving program will be able to select
the severity it wants to receive. Let's focus on emitting logs
first.

As always, we need to create an exchange first:

    :::java
    channel.exchangeDeclare(EXCHANGE_NAME, "direct");

And we're ready to send a message:

    :::java
    channel.basicPublish(EXCHANGE_NAME, severity, null, message.getBytes());

To simplify things we will assume that 'severity' can be one of
'info', 'warning', 'error'.


Subscribing
-----------

Receiving messages will work just like in the previous tutorial, with
one exception - we're going to create a new binding for each severity
we're interested in.


    :::java
    String queueName = channel.queueDeclare().getQueue();

    for(String severity : argv){    
      channel.queueBind(queueName, EXCHANGE_NAME, severity);
    }

Putting it all together

The code for `EmitLogDirect.java` class:

    #!java
    public class EmitLogDirect {
    
        private static final String EXCHANGE_NAME = "direct_logs";
    
        public static void main(String[] argv)
                      throws java.io.IOException {
    
            ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
            factory.setHost("localhost");
            Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
            Channel channel = connection.createChannel();
    
            channel.exchangeDeclare(EXCHANGE_NAME, "direct");
    
            String severity = getSeverity(argv);
            String message = getMessage(argv);
    
            channel.basicPublish(EXCHANGE_NAME, severity, null, message.getBytes());
            System.out.println(" [x] Sent '" + severity + "':'" + message + "'");
    
            channel.close();
            connection.close();
        }
        //..
    }

The code for `ReceiveLogsDirect.java`:

    #!java
    import com.rabbitmq.client.*;
    
    import java.io.IOException;
    
    public class ReceiveLogsDirect {
    
      private static final String EXCHANGE_NAME = "direct_logs";
    
      public static void main(String[] argv) throws Exception {
        ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
        factory.setHost("localhost");
        Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
        Channel channel = connection.createChannel();
    
        channel.exchangeDeclare(EXCHANGE_NAME, "direct");
        String queueName = channel.queueDeclare().getQueue();
    
        if (argv.length < 1){
          System.err.println("Usage: ReceiveLogsDirect [info] [warning] [error]");
          System.exit(1);
        }
    
        for(String severity : argv){
          channel.queueBind(queueName, EXCHANGE_NAME, severity);
        }
        System.out.println(" [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C");
    
        Consumer consumer = new DefaultConsumer(channel) {
          @Override
          public void handleDelivery(String consumerTag, Envelope envelope,
                                     AMQP.BasicProperties properties, byte[] body) throws IOException {
            String message = new String(body, "UTF-8");
            System.out.println(" [x] Received '" + envelope.getRoutingKey() + "':'" + message + "'");
          }
        };
        channel.basicConsume(queueName, true, consumer);
      }
    }

Compile as usual (see [tutorial one](tutorial-one-java.html) for compilation and classpath advice).
For convenience we'll use an environment variable $CP (that's %CP% on Windows) for the classpath when running examples.

    :::bash
    $ javac -cp $CP ReceiveLogsDirect.java EmitLogDirect.java

If you want to save only 'warning' and 'error' (and not 'info') log
messages to a file, just open a console and type:

    :::bash
    $ java -cp $CP ReceiveLogsDirect warning error > logs_from_rabbit.log

If you'd like to see all the log messages on your screen, open a new
terminal and do:

    :::bash
    $ java -cp $CP ReceiveLogsDirect info warning error
     [*] Waiting for logs. To exit press CTRL+C

And, for example, to emit an `error` log message just type:

    :::bash
    $ java -cp $CP EmitLogDirect error "Run. Run. Or it will explode."
     [x] Sent 'error':'Run. Run. Or it will explode.'

# RabbitMQ tutorial - Remote procedure call (RPC) SUPPRESS-RHS

## Remote procedure call (RPC)
### (using Spring AMQP)

<xi:include href="site/tutorials/tutorials-help.xml.inc"/>


In the [second tutorial](tutorial-two-spring-amqp.html) we learned how to
use _Work Queues_ to distribute time-consuming tasks among multiple
workers.

But what if we need to run a function on a remote computer and wait for
the result? Well, that's a different story. This pattern is commonly
known as _Remote Procedure Call_ or _RPC_.

In this tutorial we're going to use RabbitMQ to build an RPC system: a
client and a scalable RPC server. As we don't have any time-consuming
tasks that are worth distributing, we're going to create a dummy RPC
service that returns Fibonacci numbers.

### Client interface

To illustrate how an RPC service could be used we're going to
change the names of our profiles from "Sender" and "Receiver"
to "Client" and "Server". When we call the server we will get
back the fibonacci of the argument we call with. 

<pre class="lang-java">
Integer response = (Integer) template.convertSendAndReceive
    (exchange.getName(), "rpc", start++);
System.out.println(" [.] Got '" + response + "'");
</pre>

> #### A note on RPC
>
> Although RPC is a pretty common pattern in computing, it's often criticised.
> The problems arise when a programmer is not aware
> whether a function call is local or if it's a slow RPC. Confusions
> like that result in an unpredictable system and adds unnecessary
> complexity to debugging. Instead of simplifying software, misused RPC
> can result in unmaintainable spaghetti code.
>
> Bearing that in mind, consider the following advice:
>
>  * Make sure it's obvious which function call is local and which is remote.
>  * Document your system. Make the dependencies between components clear.
>  * Handle error cases. How should the client react when the RPC server is
>    down for a long time?
>
> When in doubt avoid RPC. If you can, you should use an asynchronous
> pipeline - instead of RPC-like blocking, results are asynchronously
> pushed to a next computation stage.


### Callback queue

In general doing RPC over RabbitMQ is easy. A client sends a request
message and a server replies with a response message. In order to
receive a response we need to send a 'callback' queue address with the
request. Spring AMQP's `RabbitTemplate` handles the callback queue for
us when we use the above `convertSendAndReceive()` method.  There is
no need to do any other setup when using the `RabbitTemplate`. For
a thorough explanation please see [Request/Reply Message](https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/reference/html/#request-reply).

> #### Message properties
>
> The AMQP 0-9-1 protocol predefines a set of 14 properties that go with
> a message. Most of the properties are rarely used, with the exception of
> the following:
>
> * `deliveryMode`: Marks a message as persistent (with a value of `2`)
>    or transient (any other value). You may remember this property
>    from [the second tutorial](tutorial-two-spring-amqp.html).
> * `contentType`: Used to describe the mime-type of the encoding.
>    For example for the often used JSON encoding it is a good practice
>    to set this property to: `application/json`.
> * `replyTo`: Commonly used to name a callback queue.
> * `correlationId`: Useful to correlate RPC responses with requests.

### Correlation Id

Spring AMQP allows you to focus on the message style you're working
with and hide the details of message plumbing required to support
this style. For example, typically the native client would
create a callback queue for every RPC request. That's pretty
inefficient so an alternative is to create a single callback
queue per client.

That raises a new issue, having received a response in that queue it's
not clear to which request the response belongs. That's when the
`correlationId` property is used. Spring AMQP automatically sets
a unique value for every request. In addition it handles the details
of matching the response with the correct correlationID. 

One reason that Spring AMQP makes RPC style easier is that sometimes
you may want to ignore unknown messages in the callback
queue, rather than failing with an error. It's due to a possibility of
a race condition on the server side. Although unlikely, it is possible
that the RPC server will die just after sending us the answer, but
before sending an acknowledgment message for the request. If that
happens, the restarted RPC server will process the request again.
Spring AMQP client handles the duplicate responses gracefully,
and the RPC should ideally be idempotent.

      R -&gt; C;
    }

Our RPC will work like this:

  * The `Tut6Config` will setup a new `DirectExchange` and a client
  * The client will leverage the `convertSendAndReceive` method, passing the exchange
    name, the routingKey, and the message. 
  * The request is sent to an RPC queue `tut.rpc`.
  * The RPC worker (aka: server) is waiting for requests on that queue.
    When a request appears, it performs the task and sends a message with the
    result back to the client, using the queue from the `replyTo` field.
  * The client waits for data on the callback queue. When a message
    appears, it checks the `correlationId` property. If it matches
    the value from the request it returns the response to the
    application. Again, this is done automagically via the `RabbitTemplate`.

Putting it all together
-----------------------

The Fibonacci task is a `@RabbitListener` and is defined as:

<pre class="lang-java">
public int fib(int n) {
    return n == 0 ? 0 : n == 1 ? 1 : (fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2));
}
</pre>

We declare our Fibonacci function. It assumes only valid positive integer input.
(Don't expect this one to work for big numbers,
and it's probably the slowest recursive implementation possible).

The code for our [`Tut6Config`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/blob/master/spring-amqp/src/main/java/org/springframework/amqp/tutorials/tut6/Tut6Config.java)
class looks like this:

<pre class="lang-java">
import org.springframework.amqp.core.Binding;
import org.springframework.amqp.core.BindingBuilder;
import org.springframework.amqp.core.DirectExchange;
import org.springframework.amqp.core.Queue;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Profile;

@Profile({"tut6","rpc"})
@Configuration
public class Tut6Config {

	@Profile("client")
	private static class ClientConfig {

		@Bean
		public DirectExchange exchange() {
			return new DirectExchange("tut.rpc");
		}

		@Bean
		public Tut6Client client() {
	 	 	return new Tut6Client();
		}

	}

	@Profile("server")
	private static class ServerConfig {

		@Bean
		public Queue queue() {
			return new Queue("tut.rpc.requests");
		}

		@Bean
		public DirectExchange exchange() {
			return new DirectExchange("tut.rpc");
		}

		@Bean
		public Binding binding(DirectExchange exchange, 
		    Queue queue) {
			return BindingBuilder.bind(queue)
			    .to(exchange)
			    .with("rpc");
		}

		@Bean
		public Tut6Server server() {
			return new Tut6Server();
		}

	}
}
</pre>

It sets up our profiles as `tut6` or `rpc`. It also setups a `client` profile
with 2 beans: the `DirectExchange` we are using and the `Tut6Client` itself.
We also configure the `server` profile with 3 beans, the `tut.rpc.requests`
queue, the `DirectExchange`, which matches the client's exchange, and the binding
from the queue to the exchange with the `rpc` routing-key.

The server code is rather straightforward:

  * As usual we start annotating our receiver method with a `@RabbitListener`
    and defining the queue it's listening on.
  * Our Fibonacci method calls fib() with the payload parameter and returns
    the result
  
The code for our RPC server [Tut6Server.java](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/blob/master/spring-amqp/src/main/java/org/springframework/amqp/tutorials/tut6/Tut6Server.java):

<pre class="lang-java">
package org.springframework.amqp.tutorials.tut6;

import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.annotation.RabbitListener;

public class Tut6Server {

	@RabbitListener(queues = "tut.rpc.requests")
	// @SendTo("tut.rpc.replies") used when the 
	// client doesn't set replyTo.
	public int fibonacci(int n) {
		System.out.println(" [x] Received request for " + n);
		int result = fib(n);
		System.out.println(" [.] Returned " + result);
		return result;
	}

	public int fib(int n) {
		return n == 0 ? 0 : n == 1 ? 1 : (fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2));
	}

}
</pre>



The client code [Tut6Client](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/blob/master/spring-amqp/src/main/java/org/springframework/amqp/tutorials/tut6/Tut6Client.java)
is as easy as the server:

  * We autowire the `RabbitTemplate` and the `DirectExchange` bean
    as defined in the `Tut6Config`.
  * We invoke `template.convertSendAndReceive` with the parameters
    exchange name, routing key and message.
  * We print the result

Making the client request is simple:

<pre class="lang-java">
import org.springframework.amqp.core.DirectExchange;
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.core.RabbitTemplate;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;

public class Tut6Client {

	@Autowired
	private RabbitTemplate template;

	@Autowired
	private DirectExchange exchange;

	int start = 0;

	@Scheduled(fixedDelay = 1000, initialDelay = 500)
	public void send() {
		System.out.println(" [x] Requesting fib(" + start + ")");
		Integer response = (Integer) template.convertSendAndReceive
		    (exchange.getName(), "rpc", start++);
		System.out.println(" [.] Got '" + response + "'");
	}
}
</pre>

Using the project setup as defined in [tutorial one](tutorial-one-spring-amqp.html)
with start.spring.io and Spring Initializr, the preparing of the runtime is the same as in the
other tutorials:

<pre class="lang-bash">
./mvnw clean package
</pre>

We can start the server with:

<pre class="lang-bash">
java -jar target/rabbitmq-tutorials.jar \
    --spring.profiles.active=rpc,server \
    --tutorial.client.duration=60000
</pre>

To request a fibonacci number run the client:

<pre class="lang-bash">
java -jar target/rabbitmq-tutorials.jar \
    --spring.profiles.active=rpc,client
</pre>

The design presented here is not the only possible implementation of a RPC
service, but it has some important advantages:

 * If the RPC server is too slow, you can scale up by just running
   another one. Try running a second `RPCServer` in a new console.
 * On the client side, the RPC requires sending and
   receiving only one message with one method. No synchronous calls
   like `queueDeclare` are required. As a result the RPC client needs 
   only one network round trip for a single RPC request.

Our code is still pretty simplistic and doesn't try to solve more
complex (but important) problems, like:

 * How should the client react if there are no servers running?
 * Should a client have some kind of timeout for the RPC?
 * If the server malfunctions and raises an exception, should it be
   forwarded to the client?
 * Protecting against invalid incoming messages
   (eg checking bounds, type) before processing.

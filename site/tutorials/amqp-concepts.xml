             <doc:heading>What is AMQP?</doc:heading>
               <p>
                 AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is a networking
                 protocol that enables conforming client applications to
                 communicate with conforming messaging middleware brokers.

             <doc:heading>Brokers and Their Role</doc:heading>
                 <p>
                   Messaging brokers receive messages from <em>publishers</em>
                   (applications that publish them, also known as producers) and route them to
                   <em>consumers</em> (applications
                   that process them).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   Since AMQP is a network protocol, the publishers,
                   consumers and the broker can all reside on
                   different machines.

             <doc:heading>AMQP 0-9-1 Model in Brief</doc:heading>
                 <p>
                   The AMQP 0-9-1 Model has the following view of the world:
                   messages are published to <em>exchanges</em>,
                   which are often compared to post offices or mailboxes. Exchanges then
                   distribute message copies to <em>queues</em> using rules called
                   <em>bindings</em>. Then AMQP brokers either deliver messages to
                   consumers subscribed to queues, or consumers
                   fetch/pull messages from queues on demand.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   <img src="/img/tutorials/intro/hello-world-example-routing.png"
                        alt="Publish path from publisher to consumer via
                             exchange and queue" />
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   When publishing a message, publishers may specify various
                   <em>message attributes</em> (message meta-data). Some of this
                   meta-data may be used by the broker, however, the rest of it
                   is completely opaque to the broker and is only used by
                   applications that receive the message.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   Networks are unreliable and applications may fail to process
                   messages therefore the AMQP model has a notion of
                   <em>message acknowledgements</em>: when a message is delivered
                   to a consumer the consumer <em>notifies the broker</em>,
                   either automatically or as soon as the application
                   developer chooses to do so. When message acknowledgements
                   are in use, a broker will only completely remove a message
                   from a queue when it receives a notification for that message
                   (or group of messages).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   In certain situations, for example, when a message cannot
                   be routed, messages may be <em>returned</em> to publishers,
                   dropped, or, if the broker implements an extension,
                   placed into a so-called "dead letter queue". Publishers choose
                   how to handle situations like this by publishing messages
                   using certain parameters.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   Queues, exchanges and bindings are collectively referred to as <em>AMQP entities</em>.

             <doc:heading>AMQP is a Programmable Protocol</doc:heading>
                <p>
                  AMQP 0-9-1 is a programmable protocol in the sense that AMQP
                  entities and routing schemes are defined by applications
                  themselves, not a broker administrator. Accordingly,
                  provision is made for protocol operations that declare
                  queues and exchanges, define bindings between them,
                  subscribe to queues and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This gives application developers a lot of freedom but
                  also requires them to be aware of potential definition
                  conflicts. In practice, definition conflicts are rare and
                  often indicate a misconfiguration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Applications declare the AMQP entities that they need,
                  define necessary routing schemes and may choose to delete
                  AMQP entities when they are no longer used.
                </p>

          <doc:section name="exchanges">
          <doc:heading>Exchanges and Exchange Types</doc:heading>
            <p>
              <em>Exchanges</em> are AMQP entities where messages are
              sent. Exchanges take a message and route it into zero or
              more queues. The routing algorithm used depends on the
              <em>exchange type</em> and rules called <em>bindings</em>.
              AMQP 0-9-1 brokers provide four exchange types:
            </p>
            <table>
              <tr><th>Name</th>             <th>Default pre-declared names</th></tr>
              <tr><td>Direct exchange</td>  <td>(Empty string) and amq.direct</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Fanout exchange</td>  <td>amq.fanout</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Topic exchange</td>   <td>amq.topic</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Headers exchange</td> <td>amq.match (and amq.headers in RabbitMQ)</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>
              Besides the exchange type, exchanges are declared with a number of
              attributes, the most important of which are:
            </p>
            <ul class="plain">
              <li>Name</li>
              <li>Durability (exchanges survive broker restart)</li>
              <li>Auto-delete (exchange is deleted when all queues have finished using it)</li>
              <li>Arguments (these are broker-dependent)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Exchanges can be durable or transient. Durable
              exchanges survive broker restart whereas transient
              exchanges do not (they have to be redeclared
              when broker comes back online). Not all scenarios
              and use cases require exchanges to be durable.
            </p>
             <doc:subsection name="exchange-default">
               <doc:heading>Default Exchange</doc:heading>
               <p>
                 The default exchange is a direct exchange with no name
                 (empty string) pre-declared by the broker. It has one special
                 property that makes it very useful for simple applications:
                 every queue that is created is automatically bound to it with
                 a routing key which is the same as the queue name.
               </p>
               <p>
                 For example, when you declare a queue with the name of
                 "search-indexing-online", the AMQP broker will bind it
                 to the default exchange using "search-indexing-online" as
                 the routing key. Therefore, a message published to the default
                 exchange with the routing key "search-indexing-online"
                 will be routed to the queue "search-indexing-online". In
                 other words, the default exchange makes it seem like it
                 is possible to deliver messages directly to queues, even
                 though that is not technically what is happening.
               </p>

               <doc:subsection name="exchange-direct">
               <doc:heading>Direct Exchange</doc:heading>
               <p>
                 A direct exchange delivers messages to queues based on the
                 message routing key. A direct exchange is ideal for the unicast
                 routing of messages (although they can be used for multicast
                 routing as well). Here is how it works:
                 <ul>
                   <li>A queue binds to the exchange with a routing key K</li>
                   <li>When a new message with routing key R arrives at the
                   direct exchange, the exchange routes it to the queue if K = R</li>
                 </ul>
               <p>
               </p>
                 Direct exchanges are often used to distribute tasks between
                 multiple workers (instances of the same application) in
                 a round robin manner. When doing so, it is important to
                 understand that, in AMQP 0-9-1, messages are load balanced
                 between consumers and not between queues.
               </p>
               <p>
                  A direct exchange can be represented graphically as follows:
                  <img src="/img/tutorials/intro/exchange-direct.png"
                       alt="exchange delivering messages to  queues based on routing key" />
               </p>
             </doc:subsection>
             <doc:subsection name="exchange-fanout">
               <doc:heading>Fanout Exchange</doc:heading>
               <p>
                  A fanout exchange routes messages to all of the queues
                  that are bound to it and the routing key is ignored. If N
                  queues are bound to a fanout exchange, when a new message
                  is published to that exchange a copy of the message is
                  delivered to all N queues. Fanout exchanges are ideal for
                  the broadcast routing of messages.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Because a fanout exchange delivers a copy of a message to
                  every queue bound to it, its use cases are quite similar:
                  <ul>
                  <li>Massively multi-player online (MMO) games can use it
                  for leaderboard updates or other global events</li>
                  <li>Sport news sites can use fanout exchanges for
                  distributing score updates to mobile clients in near
                  real-time</li>
                  <li>Distributed systems can broadcast various state and
                  configuration updates</li>
                  <li>Group chats can distribute messages between participants
                  using a fanout exchange (although AMQP does not have a
                  built-in concept of presence, so XMPP may be a better
                  choice)</li>
                  </ul>
               </p>
               <p>
                  A fanout exchange can be represented graphically as follows:

                       alt="exchange delivering messages to three queues" />

             <doc:subsection name="exchange-topic">
               <doc:heading>Topic Exchange</doc:heading>
               <p>
                  Topic exchanges route messages to one or many queues
                  based on matching between a message routing key and the
                  pattern that was used to bind a queue to an exchange. The
                  topic exchange type is often used to implement various
                  publish/subscribe pattern variations. Topic exchanges are
                  commonly used for the multicast routing of messages.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Topic exchanges have a very broad set of use cases. Whenever
                  a problem involves multiple consumers/applications that
                  selectively choose which type of messages they want to
                  receive, the use of topic exchanges should be considered.
               </p>

                 Example uses:

                 <li>Distributing data relevant to specific geographic
                 location, for example, points of sale</li>
                 <li>Background task processing done by multiple workers,
                 each capable of handling specific set of tasks</li>

                 <li>News updates that involve categorization or tagging
                 (for example, only for a particular sport or team)</li>

             <doc:subsection name="exchange-headers">
               <doc:heading>Headers Exchange</doc:heading>
               <p>
                 A headers exchange is designed for routing on multiple
                 attributes that are more easily expressed as message
                 headers than a routing key. Headers exchanges ignore the
                 routing key attribute. Instead, the attributes used for
                 routing are taken from the headers attribute. A message is
                 considered matching if the value of the header equals the
                 value specified upon binding.
               </p>
               <p>
                 It is possible to bind a queue to a headers exchange using
                 more than one header for matching. In this case, the broker
                 needs one more piece of information from the application
                 developer, namely, should it consider messages with any
                 of the headers matching, or all of them? This is what the
                 "x-match" binding argument is for. When the "x-match"
                 argument is set to "any", just one matching header value
                 is sufficient. Alternatively, setting "x-match" to "all"
                 mandates that all the values must match.
               </p>
               <p>
                 Headers exchanges can be looked upon as "direct exchanges
                 on steroids". Because they route based on header values,
                 they can be used as direct exchanges where the routing key
                 does not have to be a string; it could be an integer or a
                 hash (dictionary) for example.

          <doc:heading>Queues</doc:heading>
            <p>
              Queues in the AMQP model are very similar to queues in
              other message- and task-queueing systems: they store
              messages that are consumed by applications. Queues share
              some properties with exchanges, but also have some additional
              properties:
            </p>
            <ul class="plain">
              <li>Name</li>
              <li>Durable (the queue will survive a broker restart)</li>
              <li>Exclusive (used by only one connection and the queue will be deleted when that connection closes)</li>
              <li>Auto-delete (queue is deleted when last consumer unsubscribes)</li>
              <li>Arguments (some brokers use it to implement additional features like message TTL)</li>
            </ul>

             <p>
              Before a queue can be used it has to be declared. Declaring
              a queue will cause it to be created if it does not already
              exist. The declaration will have no effect if the queue does
              already exist and its attributes are the same as those in the
              declaration. When the existing queue attributes are not the
              same as those in the declaration a channel-level exception
              with code 406 (<code>PRECONDITION_FAILED</code>) will be  raised.

             <doc:heading>Queue Names</doc:heading>
             <p>
              Applications may pick queue names or ask the broker to generate
              a name for them.  Queue names may be up to 255 bytes of UTF-8
              characters.  To ask an AMQP broker to generate a unique queue
              name for you, pass an empty string as the queue name argument:
              The same generated name may be obtained by subsequent methods
              in the same channel by using the empty string where a queue
              name is expected. This works because the channel remembers the
              last server-generated queue name.
             </p>
             <p>
              Queue names starting with "amq." are reserved for internal
              use by the broker. Attempts to declare a queue with a name that
              violates this rule will result in a channel-level exception
              with reply code 403 (<code>ACCESS_REFUSED</code>).

             <p>
              Durable queues are persisted to disk and thus survive broker
              restarts. Queues that are not durable are called transient.
              Not all scenarios and use cases mandate queues to be durable.
             </p>
             <p>
              Durability of a queue does not make <em>messages</em> that
              are routed to that queue durable. If broker is taken down
              and then brought back up, durable queue will be re-declared
              during broker startup, however, only <em>persistent</em>
              messages will be recovered.

          <doc:heading>Bindings</doc:heading>
            <p>
              Bindings are rules that exchanges use (among other things)
              to route messages to queues. To instruct an exchange E to
              route messages to a queue Q,
              Q has to be <em>bound</em> to E. Bindings may have an optional
              <em>routing key</em> attribute used by some exchange types. The
              purpose of the routing key is to select certain messages published
              to an exchange to be routed to the bound queue. In other words,
              the routing key acts like a filter.
            </p>
            <p>
              To draw an analogy:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Queue is like your destination in New York city</li>
              <li>Exchange is like JFK airport</li>
              <li>Bindings are routes from JFK to your destination. There
              can be zero or many ways to reach it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Having this layer of indirection enables routing scenarios
              that are impossible or very hard to implement using publishing
              directly to queues and also eliminates certain amount of
              duplicated work application developers have to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              If AMQP message cannot be routed to any queue (for example,
              because there are no bindings for the exchange it was published
              to) it is either dropped or returned to the publisher,
              depending on message attributes the publisher has set.

          <doc:heading>Consumers</doc:heading>
            <p>
              Storing messages in queues is useless unless applications
              can <em>consume</em> them. In the AMQP 0-9-1 Model, there
              are two ways for applications to do this:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Have messages delivered to them ("push API")</li>
              <li>Fetch messages as needed ("pull API")</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With the "push API", applications have to indicate interest in
              consuming messages from a particular queue. When they do so,
              we say that they <em>register a consumer</em>
              or, simply put, <em>subscribe to a queue</em>. It is possible
              to have more than one consumer per queue or to register an
              <em>exclusive consumer</em> (excludes all other consumers from
              the queue while it is consuming).
            </p>
            <p>
              Each consumer (subscription) has an identifier called a
              <em>consumer tag</em>. It can be used to unsubscribe from
              messages. Consumer tags are just strings.
            </p>

            <doc:subsection name="message-acknowledge">
            <doc:heading>Message Acknowledgements</doc:heading>
              <p>
               Consumer applications – applications that receive and process
               messages – may occasionally fail to process individual
               messages or will sometimes just crash. There is also the possibility
               of network issues causing problems. This raises a question:
               when should the AMQP broker remove messages from queues? The
               AMQP 0-9-1 specification proposes two choices:
               <ul>
               <li>After broker sends a message to an application (using
               either <code>basic.deliver</code> or <code>basic.get-ok</code> AMQP methods).</li>
               <li>After the application sends back an acknowledgement
               (using <code>basic.ack</code> AMQP method).</li>
               </ul>
               </p>
              <p>
               The former choice is called the automatic acknowledgement
               model, while the latter is called the explicit acknowledgement
               model. With the explicit model the application chooses when
               it is time to send an acknowledgement. It can be right after
               receiving a message, or after persisting it to a data store
               before processing, or after fully processing the message
               (for example, successfully fetching a Web page, processing
               and storing it into some persistent data store).
              </p>
              <p>
               If a consumer dies without sending an acknowledgement
               the AMQP broker will redeliver it to another consumer or,
               if none are available at the time, the broker will wait until
               at least one consumer is registered for the same queue before
               attempting redelivery.

              <p>
               When a consumer application receives a message, processing
               of that message may or may not succeed. An application can
               indicate to the broker that message processing has failed
               (or cannot be accomplished at the time) by rejecting a
               message. When rejecting a message, an application can ask
               the broker to discard or requeue it. When there is only one
               consumer on a queue, make sure you do not create infinite
               message delivery loops by rejecting and requeueing a message
               from the same consumer over and over again.

               Messages are rejected with the <code>basic.reject</code> AMQP
               method. There is one limitation that <code>basic.reject</code> has:
               there is no way to reject multiple messages as you can do
               with acknowledgements. However, if you are using RabbitMQ,
               then there is a solution. RabbitMQ provides an AMQP 0-9-1
               extension known as <em>negative acknowledgements</em> or <em>nacks</em>. For
               more information, please refer to the <a href="/nack.html">

              <p>
               For cases when multiple consumers share a queue, it is useful
               to be able to specify how many messages each consumer can be
               sent at once before sending the next acknowledgement. This can
               be used as a simple load balancing technique or to improve
               throughput if messages tend to be published in batches. For
               example, if a producing application sends messages every
               minute because of the nature of the work it is doing.

          <doc:heading>Message Attributes and Payload</doc:heading>
            <p>
              Messages in the AMQP model have <em>attributes</em>. Some
              attributes are so common that the AMQP 0-9-1 specification
              defines them and application developers do not have to think
              about the exact attribute name. Some examples are
            </p>
            <ul class="plain">
              <li>Content type</li>
              <li>Content encoding</li>
              <li>Routing key</li>
              <li>Delivery mode (persistent or not)</li>
              <li>Message priority</li>
              <li>Message publishing timestamp</li>
              <li>Expiration period</li>
              <li>Publisher application id</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Some attributes are used by AMQP brokers, but most are open
              to interpretation by applications that receive them. Some
              attributes are optional and known
              as <em>headers</em>. They are similar to X-Headers in
              HTTP. Message attributes are set when a message is published.
            </p>
            <p>
              AMQP messages also have a <em>payload</em> (the data that
              they carry), which AMQP brokers treat as an opaque byte array.
              The broker will not inspect or modify the payload. It is possible
              for messages to contain only attributes and no payload. It
              is common to use serialisation formats like JSON, Thrift,
              Protocol Buffers and MessagePack to serialize structured data
              in order to publish it as the message payload. AMQP peers
              typically use the "content-type" and "content-encoding" fields to
              communicate this information,  but this is by convention only.
            </p>
            <p>
              Messages may be published as persistent, which makes the AMQP
              broker persist them to disk. If the server is restarted the
              system ensures that received persistent messages are not
              lost. Simply publishing a message to a durable exchange or the
              fact that the queue(s) it is routed to are durable doesn't make
              a message persistent: it all depends on persistence mode of the
              message itself. Publishing messages as persistent affects
              performance (just like with data stores, durability comes at a
              certain cost in performance).

          <doc:heading>Message Acknowledgements</doc:heading>
            <p>
              Since networks are unreliable and applications fail,
              it is often necessary to have some kind of processing
              acknowledgement. Sometimes it is only necessary to
              acknowledge the fact that a message has been received. Sometimes
              acknowledgements mean that a message was validated and processed
              by a consumer, for example, verified as having mandatory data
              and persisted to a data store or indexed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This situation is very common, so AMQP 0-9-1 has a built-in
              feature called <em>message acknowledgements</em> (sometimes
              referred to as <em>acks</em>) that consumers use to confirm
              message delivery and/or processing. If an application crashes
              (the AMQP broker notices this when the connection is closed), if
              an acknowledgement for a message was expected but not received
              by the AMQP broker, the message is re-queued (and possibly
              immediately delivered to another consumer, if any exists).
            </p>
            <p>
              Having acknowledgements built into the protocol helps
              developers to build more robust software.

            <p>
              AMQP 0-9-1 is structured as a number of
              <em>methods</em>. Methods are operations (like HTTP methods)
              and have nothing in common with methods in object-oriented
              programming
              languages. AMQP methods are grouped into
              <em>classes</em>. Classes are just logical groupings of AMQP
              methods. The <a href="/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html">AMQP 0-9-1
              reference</a> has full details of all the AMQP methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us take a look at the <em>exchange</em> class, a group
              of methods related to operations on exchanges. It includes
              the following operations:
            </p>
            <ul class="plain">
              <li><code>exchange.declare</code></li>
              <li><code>exchange.declare-ok</code></li>
              <li><code>exchange.delete</code></li>
              <li><code>exchange.delete-ok</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              (note that the RabbitMQ site reference also includes
              RabbitMQ-specific extensions to the exchange class that we
              will not discuss in this guide).
            </p>
            <p>
              The operations above form logical pairs:
              <code>exchange.declare</code> and
              <code>exchange.declare-ok</code>,
              <code>exchange.delete</code> and
              <code>exchange.delete-ok</code>. These operations are
              "requests" (sent by clients) and "responses" (sent by
              brokers in response to the aforementioned "requests").
            </p>
            <p>
              As an example, the client asks the broker to declare a new
              exchange using the <code>exchange.declare</code> method:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="/img/tutorials/intro/exchange-declare.png"
                   alt="exchange.declare" />
            </p>
            <p>
              As shown on the diagram above,
              <code>exchange.declare</code> carries several
              <em>parameters</em>. They enable the client to specify
              exchange name, type, durability flag and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the operation succeeds, the broker responds with the <code>exchange.declare-ok</code> method:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="/img/tutorials/intro/exchange-declare-ok.png"
                   alt="exchange.declare-ok" />
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>exchange.declare-ok</code> does not carry any
              parameters except for the channel number (channels will be
              described later in this guide).
            </p>
            <p>
              The sequence of events is very similar for another
              method pair on the AMQP <em>queue</em> class: <code>queue.declare</code> and
              <code>queue.declare-ok</code>:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="/img/tutorials/intro/queue-declare.png"
                   alt="queue.declare" />
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="/img/tutorials/intro/queue-declare-ok.png"
                   alt="queue.declare-ok" />
            </p>
            <p>
              Not all AMQP methods have counterparts. Some
              (<code>basic.publish</code> being the most widely used one)
              do not have corresponding "response" methods
              and some others (<code>basic.get</code>, for example)
              have more than one possible "response".

              AMQP connections are typically long-lived. AMQP is an
              application level protocol that uses TCP for reliable
              delivery. AMQP connections use authentication and can be
              protected using TLS (SSL). When an application no longer needs
              to be connected to an AMQP broker, it should gracefully close
              the AMQP connection instead of abruptly closing the underlying
              TCP connection.

          <doc:heading>Channels</doc:heading>
            <p>
              Some applications need multiple connections to an AMQP
              broker. However, it is undesirable to keep many TCP
              connections open at the same time because doing so consumes
              system resources and makes it more difficult to configure
              firewalls. AMQP 0-9-1 connections are multiplexed with
              <em>channels</em> that can be thought of as "lightweight
              connections that share a single TCP connection".
            </p>
            <p>
              For applications that use multiple threads/processes for
              processing, it is very common to open a new channel per thread/process
              and not share channels between them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Communication on a particular channel is completely separate
              from communication on another channel, therefore every AMQP
              method also carries a channel number that clients use to
              figure out which channel the method is for (and thus, which
              event handler needs to be invoked, for example).

          <doc:heading>Virtual Hosts</doc:heading>
            <p>
              To make it possible for a single broker to host multiple
              isolated "environments" (groups of users, exchanges,
              queues and so on), AMQP includes the concept of <em>virtual
              hosts</em> (vhosts). They are similar to virtual hosts used
              by many popular Web servers and provide completely isolated
              environments in which AMQP entities live. AMQP clients
              specify what vhosts they want to use during AMQP connection
              negotiation.

          <doc:heading>AMQP is Extensible</doc:heading>
            <p>
              AMQP 0-9-1 has several extension points:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="/devtools.html#miscellaneous">Custom exchange types</a> let developers
                  implement routing schemes that exchange types provided out-of-the-box do
                  not cover well, for example, geodata-based routing.</li>
              <li>Declaration of exchanges and queues can include additional attributes that the broker
                  can use. For example, <a href="/ttl.html">per-queue message TTL</a> in RabbitMQ is implemented this way.</li>
              <li>Broker-specific extensions to the protocol. See, for example,
                  <a href="/extensions.html">extensions that RabbitMQ implements</a>.</li>
              <li><a href="/amqp-0-9-1-quickref.html#class.confirm">New AMQP 0-9-1 method classes</a> can be introduced.</li>
              <li>Brokers can be extended with <a href="/plugins.html">additional plugins</a>,
                  for example, the <a href="/management.html">RabbitMQ management</a>
                  frontend and HTTP API are implemented as a plugin.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These features make the AMQP 0-9-1 Model even more flexible
              and applicable to a very broad range of problems.
            </p>

          <doc:section name="amqp-clients">
          <doc:heading>AMQP 0-9-1 Clients Ecosystem</doc:heading>
            <p>
              There are <a href="/devtools.html">many AMQP 0-9-1 clients</a> for many
              popular programming languages and platforms. Some of them follow AMQP terminology
              closely and only provide implementation of AMQP methods. Some
              others have additional features, convenience methods
              and abstractions. Some of the clients are asynchronous
              (non-blocking), some are synchronous (blocking), some support
              both models. Some clients support vendor-specific extensions
              (for example, RabbitMQ-specific extensions).
            </p>
            <p>
              Because one of the main AMQP goals is interoperability, it is
              a good idea for developers to understand protocol operations
              and not limit themselves to terminology of a particular client
              library. This way communicating with developers using different
              libraries will be significantly easier.

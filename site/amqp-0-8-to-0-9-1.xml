    <title>AMQP 0-8 to 0-9-1</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <p class="intro">
        This is a summary of the semantic differences between AMQP 0-8 and 0-9-1.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The advertised version number is major=0,minor=9,revision=1 rather
          than major=8,minor=0.
        </li>
        <li>
          Frame types 4-7 (OOB and trace frames) have been removed, as they
          were not well specified in AMQP 0-8.
        </li>
        <li>Status code changes:
          <ul class="plain">
            <li>Removed:
              <ul class="plain">
                <li>NOT_DELIVERED         310</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added:
              <ul class="plain">
                <li>NO_ROUTE              312 (missing from spec???)</li>
                 <li>NO_CONSUMERS          313</li>
                 <li>PRECONDITION_FAILED   406</li>
                 <li>UNEXPECTED_FRAME      505</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Access tickets have been removed. This involves the removal of the
          Access.Request method, and the deprecation of each and every ticket
          field in methods that used to require a ticket.
        </li>
        <li>
          The restrictions on virtual-host names have been removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The notions of "known hosts" and of connection redirection have
          been removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The (AMQP-specific) "PLAIN" security mechanism is no longer
          mentioned.
        </li>
        <li>
          The meaning of "channel-max" has been clarified: for example, if
          channel-max is set to 2, then it is illegal to use channels
          numbered 3 or higher for frames carried by the connection.
        </li>
        <li>
          The meaning of "frame-max" has been clarified: the maximum frame
          size is to be interpreted as including the counts for the frame
          header and end-byte.
        </li>
        <li>
          A new rule (named "upper-limit") regarding channel-max has been
          added: if the client asks for channel-max higher than that offered
          by the server, the connection MUST be closed without attempting a
          negotiated close.
        </li>
        <li>
          A similar rule (also named "upper-limit") applies to frame-max: if
          the client asks for frame-max higher than that offered by the
          server, the connection MUST be closed without attempting a
          negotiated close.
        </li>
        <li>
          The extensibility of the exchange-type mechanism is now explicitly
          documented.
        </li>
        <li>
          The rules for equivalence of exchange instances in <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#exchange.declare">Exchange.Declare</a>
          have been more clearly specified, including a specification of how
          the "arguments" tables are to be compared.
        </li>
        <li>
          Auto-deletion of exchanges is no longer supported.
        </li>
        <li>
          The AMQP 0-8 notion of "content classes" has been removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The rules for equivalence of queues in <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#queue.declare">Queue.Declare</a> have been more
          clearly specified.
        </li>
        <li>
          The rules regarding deletion of "exclusive" queues have been
          more tightly specified.
        </li>
        <li>
          A single <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.publish">Basic.Publish</a> is now defined to never result in multiple
          copies of a message on any particular queue, even in the presence
          of multiple independent bindings to the same queue that match the
          published message.
        </li>
        <li>
          Durable queues may now bind to transient exchanges. Bindings
          between a durable queue and an exchange are as durable as the bound
          exchange is.
        </li>
        <li>
          If two or more different bindings to a single queue apply to a
          given publication, only one copy of the published message is placed
          on the queue. This was intended, but not specified, in 0-8.
        </li>
        <li>
          The error code for use of an empty queue name in <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#queue.bind">Queue.Bind</a> (and
          other methods that use the most-recently-declared-queue mechanism)
          has been changed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The empty string may now be specified in <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#queue.bind">Queue.Bind</a>'s "exchange"
          field; it signifies the default exchange (!).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.recover">Basic.Recover</a> has changed: the old behaviour is available via a
          (deprecated) method <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.recover-async">Basic.RecoverAsync</a>, which has method ID 100
          (which in 0-8 was the ID for Basic.Recover). In 0-9-1, Basic.Recover has ID 110, and now has a required response,
          <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.recover-ok">Basic.RecoverOk</a> (ID 111). Also, both Basic.Recover and
          Basic.RecoverAsync are permitted on (Tx-)transacted channels in
          0-9-1, which was forbidden in 0-8.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.ack">Basic.Ack</a> is now required to signal a channel error immediately
          upon detecting an invalid deliveryTag, even if the channel is
          (Tx-)transacted. Also, it is now explicitly forbidden to
          acknowledge a particular deliveryTag more than once.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consumer tags (in <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.consume">Basic.Consume</a> etc) are defined as local to a
          channel now, not local to a connection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Message priorities have been clarified: priority 9 is the highest
          priority level (meaning that messages with priority 9 will be
          delivered ahead of any lower-priority messages), and priority 0 is
          the lowest priority level.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#channel.close">Channel.Close</a> is received while a peer is waiting for a
          <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#channel.close-ok">Channel.CloseOk</a>, a Channel.CloseOk must be sent in response as
          usual. Previously, in 0-8, such a Channel.Close was required to be
          ignored.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#connection.close">Connection.Close</a> is received while a peer is waiting for a
          <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#channel.close-ok">Connection.CloseOk</a>, a Connection.CloseOk must be sent in response
          as usual. Previously, in 0-8, such a Connection.Close was required
          to be ignored.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#connection.close">Channel.Flow</a> is specified to not apply to content carried by
          <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.get-ok">Basic.GetOk</a> methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#exchange.declare">Exchange.Declare</a>'s Durable field is no longer ignored in cases when
          the named exchange already exists at the time of the declaration.
        </li>
        <li>
          The server now MUST NOT delete an exchange that has bindings on it
          if the IfUnused field is true during an <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#exchange.delete">Exchange.Delete</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The XML requires an "amq.headers" exchange if the "headers"
          exchange type is implemented; the PDF requires an "amq.match"
          exchange if the "headers" exchange type is implemented. This is an
          error and will be resolved in a future release of the 0-9 series of
          specifications; the intention is for "amq.headers" to be
          required. "amq.match" is a legacy name and is now deprecated.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is now explicitly specified that <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#queue.delete">Queue.Delete</a> on an AutoDelete
          queue is permitted and meaningful.
        </li>
        <li>
          The rules on exclusive queues have changed: exclusivity now applies
          to all queue operations, not just consuming from the
          queue. Furthermore, passive declarations of an exclusively-held
          queue on other connections are now disallowed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generally, passive declarations are now specified to ignore most of
          the parameters given to the declaration other than the name of the
          declared entity. This was not specified in 0-8.
        </li>
        <li>
          The server now MUST NOT delete a queue that has messages in it if
          the IfEmpty field is true during a <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#queue.delete">Queue.Delete</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          When <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#queue.purge">Queue.Purge</a> is called, sent-but-unacknowledged messages are no
          longer purged, even if the channel they were sent down is not
          (Tx-)transacted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Class <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#class.tx">Tx</a> has new language around atomicity and
          multiple-queue-transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The effects of the "immediate" and "mandatory" flags on
          <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.publish">Basic.Publish</a> are explicitly declared to be undefined when used
          within a Tx transaction in 0-9-1.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#tx.rollback">Tx.Rollback</a> has been clarified: unacked messages will NOT be
          redelivered in 0-9-1 upon rollback.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "no-local" field is specified to prohibit delivery to the
          connection that published a message in 0-9-1. In 0-8, it was not
          specified whether the scope of prohibition was the channel or the
          connection.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is made clear in section 1.4.1 of the main spec that strings are
          case-sensitive.
        </li>
        <li>
          References to "chained bindings", nested message contents
          ("structured contents"), message selectors, weight, out-of-band
          frames etc have been removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is new specification around errors detected during connection
          establishment (see the end of sections 2.2.4).
        </li>
        <li>
          Section 2.2.9 reiterates the lack of requeuing and redelivering on
          <a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#tx.rollback">Tx.Rollback</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Section 2.3.7 explains the changes made to the connection and
          channel close protocols.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "Headers" exchange type is now defined (section 3.1.3.4).
        </li>
        <li>
          The use of UNEXPECTED_FRAME (code 505) is documented in section
          4.2.6.
        </li>
        <li>
          The content body size field has been clarified to mean the sum of
          the body sizes of the following content body frames.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heartbeating has been specified (section 4.2.7).
        </li>
        <li>
          Sections 4.4 (Visibility Guarantee), 4.5 (Channel Closure), 4.6
          (Content Synchronisation) and 4.7 (Content Ordering Guarantees) are
          new, interesting, and important.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some methods have been removed:
          <ul class="plain">
            <li>Connection.Redirect</li>
            <li>Channel.Alert</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Some methods have been renumbered:
          <ul class="plain">
            <li><a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#connection.close">Connection.Close</a>     60 -&gt; 50</li>
             <li><a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#connection.close-ok">Connection.CloseOk</a>   61 -&gt; 51</li>
             <li><a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.recover">Basic.Recover</a>      (see explanation above)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Some methods have been added:
          <ul class="plain">
            <li><a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#queue.unbind">Queue.Unbind</a>, methodId 50</li>
            <li><a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#queue.unbind-ok">Queue.UnbindOk</a>, methodId 51</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Some methods have new or changed arguments:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Method</th>

      <p>
        <em>Note:</em> Framing and connection establishment (modulo the removed frame-types
        and the spec version number advertisement, respectively) are identical.

        <p class="intro">RabbitMQ has inbuilt support for TLS. This includes
        client connections and popular plugins, where applicable, such as <a href="federation.html">Federation
        links</a>. It is also possible to use TLS to <a href="clustering-ssl.html">encrypt inter-node connections in clusters</a>.</p>

        <p>
          This guide covers various topics related to TLS in RabbitMQ:

          <ul>
            <li>Enabling TLS listeners in RabbitMQ</li>
            <li>How to generate self-signed certificates for development and QA environments</li>
            <li>TLS configuration in Java and .NET clients</li>
            <li>Known vulnerabilities and their migration</li>
            <li>TLS version and cipher suite configuration</li>
            <li>Certificate chain validation depth</li>
            <li>Tools that can be used to evaluate a TLS setup</li>
          </ul>

          and more. It is not, however, a primer on TLS, encryption, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure</a>
          and related topics, so the concepts are covered very briefly.
          A number of beginner-oriented primers are available elsewhere on the Web:
          <a href="https://hpbn.co/transport-layer-security-tls/">one</a>
          <a href="https://blog.talpor.com/2015/07/ssltls-certificates-beginners-tutorial/">two</a>,
          <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2016/03/enterprise-security---ssltls-primer-part-1---data-encryption.html">three</a>, <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2016/03/enterprise-security---ssltls-primer-part-2---public-key-certificates.html">four</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          TLS can be enabled for all protocols supported by RabbitMQ, not just AMQP 0-9-1,
          which this guide focuses on. <a href="/management.html">HTTP API</a> can be configured
          to use TLS (HTTPS) as well.

          <doc:heading>Using TLS for Client Connections with RabbitMQ</doc:heading>
          <p>
            For client connections, there are two common approaches:
            <ul>
              <li>Configure RabbitMQ to handle TLS connections</li>
              <li>
                Use a proxy or load balancer (such as <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAproxy</a>)
                to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy">TLS termination</a> of client connections and use plain TCP connections
                to RabbitMQ nodes.
              </li>
            </ul>

            Both approaches are valid and have pros and cons. This guide will focus on the
            first option.

          <doc:heading>Erlang/OTP Requirements for TLS Support</doc:heading>
          <p>
            In order to support TLS connections, RabbitMQ needs TLS and
            crypto-related modules to be available in the Erlang/OTP
            installation. The recommended Erlang/OTP version to use with
            TLS is the most recent <a href="/which-erlang.html">supported Erlang release</a>.
            Earlier versions, even if they are supported, may work for most certificates
            but have known limitations (see below).
          </p>

          <p>The Erlang <code>crypto</code>, <code>asn1</code>,
          <code>public_key</code>, and <code>ssl</code> libraries
          (applications) must be installed and functional. On Debian and
          Ubuntu this is provided by the <a
          href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=erlang-ssl">erlang-ssl</a>
          package. The <a
          href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/erlang-rpm">zero dependency
          Erlang RPM for RabbitMQ</a> includes the above modules.</p>

          <p>If Erlang/OTP is compiled from source, it is necessary to ensure that <code>configure</code>
          finds OpenSSL and builds the above libraries.</p>

          <p>
            When investigating TLS connectivity issues, please keep in mind that in the vast majority
            of cases they are environment-specific and do not indicate a bug or limitation
            in Erlang/OTP's TLS implementation. Please go through the steps outlined
            in the <a href="troubleshooting-ssl.html">Troubleshooting TLS guide</a> to gather
            more information first.

        <doc:subsection name="known-compatibility-issues">
          <doc:heading>Known Incompatibilities and Limitations</doc:heading>
          <p>
            If elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) cipher suites is
            expected to be used, a recent <a href="/which-erlang.html">supported Erlang release</a>
            is highly recommended. Earlier releases have known limitations around ECC support.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you face the above limitations or any other incompatibilities,
            use the TLS termination option (see above).
          </p>
          <p>
            For Windows XP users running RabbitMQ as a service: It is not possible to
            use SSL with RabbitMQ running as a service on Windows XP in combination with
            OpenSSL versions 0.9.8 or later. The bug has been confirmed on Windows XP SP3
            with OpenSSL v0.9.8r and v1.0.0d. Suggested workarounds if you want to run RabbitMQ
            as a service is to upgrade to a later Windows release or downgrade to an earlier version of
            OpenSSL (v0.9.7e is known to work).

        <doc:heading>The Short Route to Generating a CA, Certificates, and Keys</doc:heading>
        <p>
          This guide walks you through the process of setting up a <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Certificate
          Authority</a> and using it to generate client and server
          certificate/key pairs. Keys and certificates are necessary
          for RabbitMQ and clients that connect to the server on a
          TLS-enabled port. However, the process is fairly labourious
          and can be error-prone. An easier way of generating all that
          stuff on MacOS or Linux is with <a
          href="https://github.com/michaelklishin/tls-gen">tls-gen</a>:
          you will need <code>Python 3.4+</code>, <code>make</code> and <code>openssl</code>
          in <code>PATH</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <code>tls-gen</code> and the certificate/key pairs
          it generates are self-signed and only suitable for development
          and test environments. The vast majority of production environments
          should use certificates and keys issued by a well known commercial
          CA.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>tls-gen</code> supports RSA and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/">Elliptic Curve Cryptography</a> algorithms for key generation.

      <doc:section name="keys-and-certs">
        <doc:heading>Keys, Certificates and CA Certificates</doc:heading>
          <p>
            TLS is a large and complex topic. For a thorough understanding of
            TLS, OpenSSL and how to get the most out of it, we would recommend the use
            of other resources, for example <a class="extlink" href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596002701/">Network Security with
            OpenSSL</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            TLS can be used simply to establish an encrypted communication
            channel, but can additionally exchange signed certificates between the
            end points of the channel, and those certificates can optionally be
            verified. The verification of a certificate requires establishing a
            chain of trust from a known, trusted <i>root</i> certificate, and the
            certificate presented. The <i>root</i> certificate is a self-signed
            certificate, made available by a <i>Certificate Authority</i>. These
            exist as commercial companies, and will, for a fee, sign TLS (x509)
            certificates that you have generated.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the purposes of this guide, we will start by creating our own
            <i>Certificate Authority</i>. Once we have done this, we will generate
            signed certificates for the server and clients, in a number of
            formats. These will we then use with the Java, .Net and Erlang AMQP
            clients. Note that Mono has more stringent requirements on OpenSSL
            certificates (and a few bugs too), so we will be specifying slightly
            more stringent key usage constraints than is normally necessary.
          </p>
<pre class="sourcecode bash">
mkdir testca
cd testca
mkdir certs private
chmod 700 private
echo 01 &gt; serial
touch index.txt
</pre>
          <p>
            Now place the following in <code>openssl.cnf</code> within the <code>testca</code>
            directory we've just created:
          </p>

<pre class="sourcecode ini">
[ ca ]
default_ca = testca

[ testca ]
dir = .
certificate = $dir/cacert.pem
database = $dir/index.txt
new_certs_dir = $dir/certs
private_key = $dir/private/cakey.pem
serial = $dir/serial

default_crl_days = 7
default_days = 365
default_md = sha256

policy = testca_policy
x509_extensions = certificate_extensions

[ testca_policy ]
commonName = supplied
stateOrProvinceName = optional
countryName = optional
emailAddress = optional
organizationName = optional
organizationalUnitName = optional
domainComponent = optional

[ certificate_extensions ]
basicConstraints = CA:false

[ req ]
default_bits = 2048
default_keyfile = ./private/cakey.pem
default_md = sha256
prompt = yes
distinguished_name = root_ca_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = root_ca_extensions

[ root_ca_distinguished_name ]
commonName = hostname

[ root_ca_extensions ]
basicConstraints = CA:true
keyUsage = keyCertSign, cRLSign

[ client_ca_extensions ]
basicConstraints = CA:false
keyUsage = digitalSignature,keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2

[ server_ca_extensions ]
basicConstraints = CA:false
keyUsage = digitalSignature,keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1
</pre>
          <p>
            Now we can generate the key and certificates that our test
            <i>Certificate Authority</i> will use. Still within the <code>testca</code>
            directory:
          </p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
openssl req -x509 -config openssl.cnf -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 \
    -out cacert.pem -outform PEM -subj /CN=MyTestCA/ -nodes
openssl x509 -in cacert.pem -out cacert.cer -outform DER
</pre>

          <p>
            This is all that is needed to generate our test <i>Certificate
            Authority</i>. The <i>root</i> certificate is in <code>testca/cacert.pem</code>
            and is also in <code>testca/cacert.cer</code>. These two files contain the
            same information, but in different formats. Whilst the vast majority
            of the world is perfectly happy to use the <i>PEM</i> format, Microsoft
            and Mono like to be different, and so use the <i>DER</i> format.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having set up our <i>Certificate Authority</i>, we now need to generate
            keys and certificates for the clients and the server. The Erlang
            client and the RabbitMQ broker are both able to use <i>PEM</i> files
            directly.  They will both be informed of three files: the <i>root</i>
            certificate, which is implicitly trusted, the private key, which is
            used to prove ownership of the public certificate being presented, and
            the public certificate itself, which identifies the peer.
          </p>
          <p>
            For convenience, we provide to the Java and .Net clients, a <i>PKCS
            #12</i> store, which contains both the client's certificate and key. The
            <i>PKCS store</i> is usually password protected itself, and so that
            password must also be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process for creating server and client certificates is very
            similar. First the server:
          </p>
<pre class="sourcecode bash">
cd ..
ls
# => testca
mkdir server
cd server
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out req.pem -outform PEM \
    -subj /CN=$(hostname)/O=server/ -nodes
cd ../testca
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -in ../server/req.pem -out \
    ../server/cert.pem -notext -batch -extensions server_ca_extensions
cd ../server
openssl pkcs12 -export -out keycert.p12 -in cert.pem -inkey key.pem \
    -passout pass:MySecretPassword
</pre>

          <p>
          And now the client:
<pre class="sourcecode bash">
cd ..
ls
# => server testca
mkdir client
cd client
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out req.pem -outform PEM \
    -subj /CN=$(hostname)/O=client/ -nodes
cd ../testca
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -in ../client/req.pem -out \
    ../client/cert.pem -notext -batch -extensions client_ca_extensions
cd ../client
openssl pkcs12 -export -out keycert.p12 -in cert.pem -inkey key.pem \
    -passout pass:MySecretPassword
</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            The two examples above generate private keys that are 2048 bits in size.
            It is possible to use longer (and thus more secure but also slower to generate)
            keys by providing a different value to <code>openssl genrsa</code>, e.g.:

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 4096
</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            Another option would be to generate a key using <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/">Elliptic Curve Cryptography</a>. Instead of <code>openssl genrsa</code> use
            <code>openssl ecparam</code> like so:

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
openssl ecparam -out key.pem -genkey -name prime256v1
</pre>

            <code>prime256v1</code> in the example above is an elliptic curve name.
            Different versions of OpenSSL will have a different set of curves available,
            list them with <code>openssl ecparam -list_curves</code>.
          </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="enabling-ssl">
        <doc:heading>Enabling TLS Support in RabbitMQ</doc:heading>

          <p>To enable the SSL/TLS support in RabbitMQ, we need to
          provide to RabbitMQ the location of the <i>root</i>
          certificate, the server's certificate file, and the server's
          key. We also need to tell it to listen on a socket that is
          going to be used for TLS connections, and we need to tell it
          whether it should ask for clients to present certificates,
          and if the client does present a certificate, whether we
          should accept the certificate if we can't establish a chain
          of trust to it. These settings are controlled by
          severalconfiguration keys:</p>

          <ul class="plain">
            <li>
              <code>listeners.ssl</code>: this is a list of ports to listen on for TLS
              connections. RabbitMQ can listen on a single interface or multiple ones.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>ssl_options.cacertfile</code>: Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file path
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>ssl_options.certfile</code>: server certificate file path
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>ssl_options.keyfile</code>: server private key file path
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>ssl_options.verify</code>: should <a href="#peer-verification">peer verification</a> be enabled?
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert</code>: when set to true, TLS connection
              will be rejected if client fails to provide a certificate
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The simplest way to set these options, is to edit the <a
            href="configure.html#configuration-file">configuration
            file</a>.  An example of the config file is below, which
            will start one ssl_listener on port 5671 on all interfaces
            on this hostname:
          </p>

<pre class="sourcecode ini">
listeners.ssl.default = 5671

ssl_options.cacertfile = /path/to/testca/cacert.pem
ssl_options.certfile = /path/to/server/cert.pem
ssl_options.keyfile = /path/to/server/key.pem
ssl_options.verify = verify_peer
ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert = false
</pre>

Below is the same example using the <a href="/configure.html#erlang-term-config-file">classic config format</a>:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[
  {rabbit, [
     {ssl_listeners, [5671]},
     {ssl_options, [{cacertfile,"/path/to/testca/cacert.pem"},
                    {certfile,"/path/to/server/cert.pem"},
                    {keyfile,"/path/to/server/key.pem"},
                    {verify,verify_peer},
                    {fail_if_no_peer_cert,false}]}
   ]}
].
</pre>

          <p>
            <b>Note to Windows users:</b> Backslashes ("\") in the
            configuration file are interpreted as escape sequences -
            so for example to specify the
            path <code>c:\cacert.pem</code> for the CA certificate you
            would need to use <code>"c:\\cacert.pem"</code> or <code>"c:/cacert.pem"</code>.
          </p>

          <p>When a web browser connects to an HTTPS web server, the
          server presents its public certificate, the web browser
          attempts to establish a chain of trust between the root
          certificates the browser is aware of and the server's
          certificate, and all being well, an encrypted communication
          channel is established. Although not used normally by web
          browsers and web servers, TLS allows the server to ask the
          client to present a certificate. In this way the server can
          verify that the client is who they say they are.</p>

          <p>This policy of whether or not the server asks for a
          certificate from the client, and whether or not they demand
          that they are able to trust the certificate, is what the
          <code>verify</code> and <code>fail_if_no_peer_cert</code>
          arguments control. By setting
          the <code>fail_if_no_peer_cert</code> option to <code>false</code>, we state
          that we're prepared to accept clients which don't have a
          certificate to send us, but through the
          <code>verify</code> option set to <code>verify_peer</code>, we state that if
          the client does send us a certificate, we must be able to
          establish a chain of trust to it.</p>

          <p>Note that if the <code>verify_none</code> mode is used,

          <doc:heading>TLS Peer Verification: Who Do You Say You Are?</doc:heading>

          <p>
            When a TLS connection is established there are two important stages in
            the protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first stage is when the peers <em class="">optionally</em> exchange
            certificates. Each peer usually provides a <em class="">chain of certificates</em> begins with a "leaf"
            (client or server) certificate and continues with at least one Certificate Authority (CA) certificate. That
            CA issued (signed) the leaf CA. If there are multiple CA certificates, they usually form a chain of signatures,
            meaning that each CA certificate was signed by the next one. The very last (or only) CA is often referred
            to as the <em class="">root CA</em> for the chain. Root CAs can be issued by well-known Certifica Authorities
            (commercial vendors) or any other party (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate">self-signed</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Having exchanged certificates, the peers can <em class="">optionally</em> attempt
            to establish a chain of trust between their root
            certificates, and the certificates presented. This acts to verify that
            the peer is who it claims to be (provided the private key hasn't been
            stolen). The process is known as peer verification.
          </p>
          <p>
            During peer verification TLS connection client (or server) traverses
            the chain of certificates presented by the peer
            and if a trusted certificate is found, considers the peer trusted.
            If no trusted certificate is found, peer verification fails.
          </p>
          <p>
            The configuration demonstrated so far instructs RabbitMQ
            to use the <code>testca/cacert.pem</code> for the CA
            (Certificate Authority) file.  This contains just the
            public certificate of the test <i>Certificate
            Authority</i> created.  When clients (applications_
            connect, they will present their own certificates. Those
            may (and often will) have been signed by other
            <i>Certificate Authorities</i>. In order for RabbitMQ
            node(s) to accept those connections and treat clusters as
            trusted, it is necessary to make RabbitMQ trust all of
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every TLS implementation, including Erlang/OTP and
            OpenSSL, has a set of certificates that are considered to
            be trusted. On Linux and other UNIX-like systems this is
            usually a directory administered by superusers.  CA
            certificates in that directory will be considered trusted,
            and so are the certificates issued by them (such as those
            presented by clients). While it is possible to place final ("leaf") certificates
            such as those used by servers and clients to the trusted certificate directory,
            a much more practice is to ad CA certificates to the trusted certificate list.
            Locations of the trusted certificate directory will <a href="https://www.happyassassin.net/2015/01/12/a-note-about-ssltls-trusted-certificate-stores-and-platforms/">vary</a>
            <a href="http://gagravarr.org/writing/openssl-certs/others.shtml">between distributions</a>, operating systems and releases.
          </p>

          <p>
            On Windows trusted certificates are managed using tools such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/certmgr-exe-certificate-manager-tool">certmgr</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another way would be to append these certificates to one
            another and use the combined Certificate Authority file
            argument to RabbitMQ:

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
cat testca/cacert.pem otherca/cacert.pem &gt; all_cacerts.pem
</pre>

            Note that this approach is only practical with a very small number of CAs involved,
            and only <i>root</i> CAs will be used as trust anchors (any intermediate certificates 
            will be ignored).
            The above approach with trusted certificate lists is recommended.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second stage is where the peers negotiate a symmetric encryption
            key that will be used for the rest of the communication. If
            certificates were exchanged, the public/private keys will be used in
            the key negotiation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus it is possible to create an encrypted TLS connection <em class="">without</em> having to
            verify certificates. Client libraries usually support both modes of operation.
          </p>

          <p>
            When peer verification is enabled, it is common for clients to also check whether the
            the <em class="">hostname</em> of the server
            they are connecting to matches one of two fields in the server certificate: the <em class="">SAN (Subject Alternative Name)</em> or <em class="">CN (Common Name)</em>. If there is no match, peer verification will also be
            failed by the client. However, this check is not necessarily performed by all clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why some commands at the start of this guide specify
            <code>...-subj /CN=$(hostname)/...</code> which dynamically looks up your
            hostname. If the certificates are generated on one machine and used
            on other machines then the <code>$(hostname)</code>
            value should be replaced with the correct hostname of the target server.
          </p>
          <p>
            Servers also can perform peer verification on clients.
            On the server end, peer verification is primarily controlled using two <code>rabbit.ssl_options</code>
            options: <code>verify</code> and <code>fail_if_no_peer_cert</code>. For example, the following
            config will perform peer verification and reject clients that do not provide
            a certificate:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[
  {rabbit, [
     {ssl_listeners, [5671]},
     {ssl_options, [{cacertfile,"/path/to/testca/cacert.pem"},
                    {certfile,"/path/to/server/cert.pem"},
                    {keyfile,"/path/to/server/key.pem"},
                    {verify, verify_peer},
                    {fail_if_no_peer_cert, true}]}
   ]}
].
</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              How exactly peer verification is configured in client libraries varies from library to library.
            </p>
            <p>
              Peer verification is highly recommended in production environments. With careful consideration,
              disabling it can make sense in certain environments (e.g. development).

          <p>
            During TLS connection negotiation, the server and the client negotiate
            what cipher suite will be used. It is possible to force server's TLS
            implementation to dictate its preference (cipher suite order) to avoid
            malicious clients that intentionally negotiate weak cipher suites in
            preparation for running an attack on them.
            To do so, configure <code>honor_cipher_order</code>
            and <code>honor_ecc_order</code> to <code>true</code>:
          </p>

          <doc:heading>Key Managers, Trust Managers and Stores</doc:heading>
            <p>There are three components to be aware of in the Java security
            framework: Key Manager, Trust Manager and Key Store.</p>
            <p>A Key Manager is used by a peer to manage its certificates. This means
            that in a session set-up, the Key Manager will control which
            certificates to send to the remote peer.</p>
            <p>A Trust Manager is used by a peer to manage remote certificates. This
            means that in a session set-up, the Trust Manager will control which
            certificates are trusted from a remote peer.</p>
            <p>A Key Store is a Java encapsulation of certificates. Java needs all
            certificates to either be converted into a Java specific binary format
            or to be in the PKCS#12 format. These formats are managed using the
            Key Store class. For the server certificate, we'll use the Java binary
            format, but for client key/certificate pair, we'll use the PKCS#12
            format.</p>

        factory.useSslProtocol();
        // Tells the library to setup the default Key and Trust managers for you

<pre class="sourcecode bash">

          <p>For a server certificate to be understood on the .Net platform, they
          can be in a number of formats including <i>DER</i> and <i>PKCS #12</i>, but
          of course, not <i>PEM</i>. For the <i>DER</i> format, .Net expects them to
          be stored in files with <code>.cer</code> extension. In the steps above, when
          creating the test <i>Certificate Authority</i>, we converted the
          certificate from <i>PEM</i> to <i>DER</i> format using:</p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
openssl x509 -in /path/to/testca/cacert.pem -out /path/to/testca/cacert.cer -outform DER
</pre>
          <p>PEM is a base64 encoding of this DER format, enclosed within
          delimiters. This encoding is usually done to make it easier to
          transfer the data over 7-bit limited protocols, such as email (SMTP).</p>


        <doc:subsection name="mono">
          <doc:heading>RFC 5280, Certificate Key Usage and Mono</doc:heading>
          <p>As mentioned above, Mono is rather more stringent than is normal about
          enforcing that certificates are only used for the purposes indicated
          by the certificate itself.</p>
          <p>SSL certificate and keys can be used for a variety of purposes, for
          example, email signing, code signing, traffic encryption, etc. (For
          our purposes, we're interested in TCP Traffic encryption).  RFC 5280
          specifies a number of different purposes, and allows a certificate to
          be signed for a specific set of purposes.</p>
          <p>SSL v3 certificates can contain a number of different extensions. The
          extension that deals with how a certificate can be used is call the
          <i>Key Usage Extension</i>. The various usages permitted are not, in
          general, well supported, or even well defined, and their usage is
          subject to wide interpretation. Some of the key usages have been
          deprecated, and mainly, they're just totally ignored.</p>

          <p>There is a further extension, which also specifies usages, but chooses
          to do so using O.I.Ns, such as "1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1". Clearly English is
          lacking something that apparently random numbers add. This is the
          <i>Extended Key Usage</i> extension - a sequence of object identifiers
          that further defines which uses of the certificate are permissible.</p>

          <p>Mono, however, seems to think that these extensions are both
          important, and need to be observed. Mono chooses to invalidate the
          certificate if the certificate omits a <i>Key Usage Extension</i>. By
          default, OpenSSL omits the <i>Key Usage Extension</i> for self-signed
          certificates because it is expected that if no <i>Key Usage Extension</i>
          is found, the certificate is valid to be used for any purpose.</p>

          <p>This is the reason why in the sample <code>openssl.cnf</code> file listed
          above, the extensions specified for <code>root_ca_extensions</code>,
          <code>client_ca_extensions</code> and <code>server_ca_extensions</code>
          all have <code>keyUsage</code> specified, and the latter two also have
          <code>extendedKeyUsage</code> defined. Thus the certificates generated above are
          valid for use by Mono; <code>keyEncipherment</code> specifies that the
          certificate can be used by an SSL Server, and <code>digitalSignature</code>

          specifies that the certificate can be used by an SSL client. The
          values in the <code>extendedKeyUsage</code> fields say the
          same thing.</p>
          <p>You can use <a class="extlink" href="http://gist.github.com/145812">this small tool</a> to
          check that the certificate <i>presented by the RabbitMQ server</i> is
          acceptable to Mono.  Note that you'll need to convert the <code>server/cert.pem</code> to <code>server/cert.cer</code> using an appropriate OpenSSL command:</p>

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
openssl x509 -in /path/to/server/cert.pem -out /path/to/server/cert.cer -outform DER
mono certcheck.exe /path/to/server/cert.
# ...

          <doc:heading>TLS Peer Verification in .NET</doc:heading>
            <p>
              TLS offers peer verification (validation), a way for client and server to
              verify each other's identity based on peer's certificate information.
              When peer verification is enabled, typically the <em class="">hostname</em> of the server
              you're connecting to needs to match the <em class="">CN (Common Name)</em> field on
              the server's certificate, otherwise the certificate will be
              rejected. However, peer verification doesn't have to be limited to just CN
              and hostname matching in general.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why the commands at the start of this guide specify
              <code>...-subj /CN=$(hostname)/...</code> which dynamically looks up your
              hostname. If you're generating certificates on one machine, and using
              them on the other then be sure to swap out the <code>$(hostname)</code>
              section, and replace it with the correct hostname for your server.
            </p>

              In RabbitMQ .NET client, <code>RabbitMQ.Client.SslOption.CertificateValidatioNCallback</code>

              delegate. The delegate will be used to verify peer (RabbitMQ node) identity using whatever logic fits
              the application.

              If this is not specified, the default callback will be
              used in conjunction with the AcceptablePolicyErrors
              property to determine if the remote server certificate is

            <p>On the .NET platform, remote certificates are managed by putting them
            into any of a number of Stores. All management of these stores is done
            with the 'certmgr' tool which is available on both Microsoft's
            .Net implementation and on Mono.</p>
          <p>NB: On some flavours of Windows there are two versions of
            the command - one that ships with the operating system and
            provides a graphical interface only, and one that ships
            with the Windows SDK and provides both a
            graphical and command line interface. Either will do the

            in a separate PKCS #12 file, all we need to do is to import the
            certificate of the root <i>Certificate Authority</i> into
            the <i>Root</i> (Windows) / <i>Trust</i> (Mono)

            store. All certificates signed by any certificate in that

              In contrast to the Java client, which is happy to use an
              SSL connection without verifying the server's
              certificate, the .NET client by default requires this
              verification to succeed. To suppress verification, an
              application can set
              the <code>System.Net.Security.SslPolicyErrors.RemoteCertificateNotAvailable</code>

        <doc:heading>Certificate Chains and Verification Depth</doc:heading>
        <p>
          When using a client certificate signed by an intermediate CA, it may be necessary
          to configure RabbitMQ server to use a higher verification depth.

          The depth is the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates that
          may follow the peer certificate in a valid certification path.
          So if depth is 0 the peer (e.g. client) certificate must be signed by the trusted CA directly,
          if 1 the path can be "peer, CA, trusted CA", if it is 2 "peer, CA, CA, trusted CA", and so on.

          The following example demonstrates how to configure certificate validation depth for
          RabbitMQ server:
<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[
  {rabbit, [
     {ssl_listeners, [5671]},
     {ssl_options, [{cacertfile,"/path/to/testca/cacert.pem"},

            Because TLS has many configurable parameters
            and some of them have suboptimal defaults for historical
            reasons, TLS setup evaluation is a recommended practice.
            Multiple tools exist that perform various tests on TLS-enabled
            server endpoints, for example, testing whether it is prone

            tool that can be used with protocol endpoints that do not serve HTTP.
            Note that the tool performs many tests (for instance, on some machines it runs
            over 350 cipher suite tests alone) and passing every single one may or may not
            make sense for every environment. For example, many production deployments
            do not use CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists); most development environments
            use self-signed certificates and don't have to worry about

        <p>
          When using a client certificate signed by an intermediate CA, it may be necessary
          to configure RabbitMQ server to use a higher verification depth.

          The depth is the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates that
          may follow the peer certificate in a valid certification path.
          So if depth is 0 the peer (e.g. client) certificate must be signed by the trusted CA directly,
          if 1 the path can be "peer, CA, trusted CA", if it is 2 "peer, CA, CA, trusted CA", and so on.

          The following example demonstrates how to configure certificate validation depth for
          RabbitMQ server:
<pre class="sourcecode">
listeners.ssl.1 = 5671
ssl_options.cacertfile = /path/to/testca/cacert.pem
ssl_options.certfile   = /path/to/server/cert.pem
ssl_options.keyfile    = /path/to/server/key.pem
ssl_options.depth      = 2
ssl_options.verify     = verify_peer
ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert = false
</pre>

Using the <a href="/configure.html#erlang-term-config-file">classic config format</a>:

<pre class="sourcecode">[

          <p>Enabling TLS in the RabbitMQ Erlang client is rather
          straightforward. In the <code>#amqp_params_network</code> record, we just need to
          supply values in the <code>ssl_options</code> field. These, you will recognise
          from the options we specified to RabbitMQ.</p>

            <p>The three important options which must be supplied are:</p>
            <ul class="plain">
              <li> The <code>cacertfile</code> option specifies the certificates of the root
              <i>Certificate Authorities</i> that we wish to implicitly trust.</li>
              <li> The <code>certfile</code> is the client's own certificate in PEM format</li>
              <li> The <code>keyfile</code> is the client's private key file in PEM format.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><code>server_name_indication</code> - set this option to the host name of the server
              to which a TLS connection will be made to enable "Server Name Indication" verification
              of the certificate presented by the server. This ensures that the server certificate's
              <code>CN=</code> value will be verified during TLS connection establishment. You can
              override this behavior by setting <code>server_name_indication</code> to a different
              host name or to the special value <code>disable</code> to disable this
              verification. Note that, by default, SNI is <b>not</b> enabled. This default
              will change in a future RabbitMQ Erlang client release.
            </p>
            <p><code>verify</code> - set this option to <code>verify_peer</code> to enable X509
              certificate chain verification. The <code>depth</code> option configures certificate
              verification depth. Note that, by default, <code>verify</code> is set to
              <code>verify_none</code>, which disables certificate chain verification. This default
              will change in a future RabbitMQ Erlang client release.

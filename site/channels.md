# Channels

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

This guide covers various topics related to channels, an [AMQP 0-9-1](/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html)-specific abstraction.
Channels cannot exist without a connection, so getting familiar with the [Connections guide](/connections.html) first
is highly recommended.

This guide covers:

 * [The basics](#basics) of channels
 * [Channel lifecycle](#lifecycle)
 * Channel [resource usage](#resource-usage)
 * [Monitoring](#monitoring) and metrics related to channels and how to identify common problems
 * [Flow control](#flow-control)

and other topics related to connections.

## <a id="basics" class="anchor" href="#basics">The Basics</a>

Some applications need multiple logical connections to the
broker. However, it is undesirable to keep many TCP
connections open at the same time because doing so consumes
system resources and makes it more difficult to configure
firewalls. AMQP 0-9-1 connections are multiplexed with
`channels` that can be thought of as "lightweight
connections that share a single TCP connection".

Every protocol operation performed by a client happens on a channel.
Communication on a particular channel is completely separate
from communication on another channel, therefore every protocol
method also carries a channel ID (a.k.a. channel number), an integer
that both the broker and clients use to figure out which channel the method is for.

A channel only exists in the context of a connection and never on its own.
When a connection is closed, so are all channels on it.

For applications that use multiple threads/processes for
processing, it is very common to open a new channel per thread/process
and not share channels between them.


## <a id="lifecycle" class="anchor" href="#lifecycle">Channel Lifecycle</a>

### Opening Channels

Applications open a channel right after successfully opening a [connection](/connections.html).

Here's a Java client example that opens a new channel with an automatically allocated channel ID
after opening a new connection:

<pre class="lang-java">
ConnectionFactory cf = new ConnectionFactory();
Connection conn = cf.createConnection();

Channel ch = conn.createChannel();

// ... use the channel to declare topology, publish, consume
</pre>

In .NET client channels are represented using the `IModel` interface, so the names in the API
are different:

<pre class="lang-csharp">
var cf = new ConnectionFactory();
var conn = cf.newConnection();

// the .NET client calls channels "models"
var ch = conn.CreateModel();

// ... use the channel to declare topology, publish, consume
</pre>

Much like connections, channels are meant to be long lived. That is, there is no need to open
a channel per operation and doing so would be very inefficient, since opening a channel is a
network roundtrip.

### Closing Channels

When a channel is no longer needed, it should be closed. Closing a channel will render it
unusable and schedule its resources to be reclaimed:

<pre class="lang-java">
Channel ch = conn.createChannel();

// do some work

// close the channel when it is no longer needed

ch.close();
</pre>

The same example using the .NET client:

<pre class="lang-csharp">
// the .NET client calls channels "models"
var ch = conn.CreateModel();

// do some work

// close the channel when it is no longer needed

ch.Close();
</pre>

As mentioned above, a closed channel cannot be used. An attempt to perform an operation
on a closed channel will result in an exception that says that the channel has already been
closed.

When a channel's connection is closed, so is the channel.

### <a id="error-handling" class="anchor" href="#error-handling">Channels and Error Handling</a>

In the section above channels were closed by applications. There is another way a channel can
be closed: due to a protocol exception.

Certain scenarios are assumed to be recoverable ("soft") errors in the protocol. They render
the channel closed but applications can open another one and try to recover or retry a number of
times. Most common examples are:

 * [Redeclaring an existing queue](/queues.html#property-equivalence) or exchange with non-matching properties
   will fail with a `406 PRECONDITION_FAILED` error
 * [Accessing a resource](/access-control.html) the user is not allowed to access will fail
   with a `403 ACCESS_REFUSED` error
 * Binding a non-existing queue or a non-existing exchange will fail with a `404 NOT_FOUND` error
 * Consuming from a queue that does not exist will fail with a `404 NOT_FOUND` error
 * Publishing to an exchange that does not exit will fail with a `404 NOT_FOUND` error
 * Accessing an [exclusive queue](/queues.html#exclusive-queues) from a connection other than its declaring one will
   fail with a `405 RESOURCE_LOCKED`

Client libraries provide a way to observe and react to channel exceptions. For example, in the Java
client there is [a way to register an error handler](/api-guide.html#shutdown) and access a channel
shutdown (closure) reason.

Any attempted operation on a closed channel will fail with an exception. Note that when RabbitMQ
closes a channel, it notifies the client of that using an asynchronous protocol method. In other words,
an operation that caused a channel exception won't fail immediately but a channel closure event
handler will fire shortly after.

Some client libraries may use blocking operations that wait for
a response. In this case they may communicate channel exceptions differently, e.g. using
runtime exceptions, an error type, or other means appropriate for the language.

See the [AMQP 0-9-1 Reference](/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html) for a more complete list of
error codes.


## <a id="resource-usage" class="anchor" href="#resource-usage">Resource Usage</a>

Each channel consumes a relatively small amount of memory on the client. Depending on client library's
implementation detail it can also use a dedicated thread pool (or similar) where consumer
operations are dispatched, and therefore one or more threads (or similar).

Each channel also consumes a relatively small amount of memory on the node the client is connected to,
plus a few Erlang processes. Since a node usually serves multiple channel connections, the effects
of excessive channel usage or channel leaks will primarily be reflected in RabbitMQ nodes' [metrics](#monitoring)
and not those of clients.

Given both of these factors, limiting the number of channels used per connection is highly recommended.
As a rule of thumb, most applications can use a single digit number of channels per connection.
Those with particularly high concurrency rates (usually such applications are [consumers](/consumers.html))
can start with one channel per thread/process/coroutine and switch to channel pooling
when metrics suggest that the original model is no longer sustainable, e.g. because it consumes
too much memory.

See the [Monitoring, Metrics and Diagnostics](#monitoring) section to learn about how to inspect
channels, the number of channels on a connectio, channel churn rate and so on.

### <a id="channel-max" class="anchor" href="#channel-max">Maximum Number of Channels per Connection</a>

The maximum number of channels that can be open on a connection simultaneously
is negotiated by client and server at connection time. The value is configurable for
both RabbitMQ and client libraries.

On the server side, the limit is controlled using the `channel_max`:

<pre class="lang-ini">
# no more 100 channels can be opened on a connection at the same time
channel_max = 100
</pre>

In the [classic config format](/configure.html#configuration-files), the key is `rabbit.channel_max`:

<pre class="lang-erlang">
[
  {rabbit, [
    %% no more 100 channels can be opened on a connection at the same time
    {channel_max, 100}
  ]}
].
</pre>

Should the configured limit be exceeded, the connection will be closed with a fatal
error:

<pre class="lang-ini">
2019-02-11 16:04:06.296 [error] &lt;0.887.0&gt; Error on AMQP connection &lt;0.887.0&gt; (127.0.0.1:49956 -&gt; 127.0.0.1:5672, vhost: '/', user: 'guest', state: running), channel 23:
 operation none caused a connection exception not_allowed: "number of channels opened (22) has reached the negotiated channel_max (22)"
</pre>

Clients can be configured to allow fewer channels per connection. With [RabbitMQ Java client](/api-guide.html),
`ConnectionFactory#setRequestedChannelMax` is the method that controls the limit:

<pre class="lang-java">
ConnectionFactory cf = new ConnectionFactory();
// Ask for up to 32 channels per connection. Will have an effect as long as the server is configured
// to use a higher limit, otherwise the server's limit will be used.
cf.setRequestedChannelMax(32);
</pre>

With [RabbitMQ .NET client](/dotnet-api-guide.html), use the `ConnectionFactory#RequestedChannelMax`
property:

<pre class="lang-csharp">
var cf = new ConnectionFactory();
// Ask for up to 32 channels per connection. Will have an effect as long as the server is configured
// to use a higher limit, otherwise the server's limit will be used.
cf.RequestedChannelMax = 32;
</pre>

The lower value of the two is used: the client cannot
be configured to allow for more channels than the server configured maximum.
Clients that attempt that will run into an error that looks like this in the logs:

<pre class="lang-ini">
2019-02-11 16:03:16.543 [error] &lt;0.882.0&gt; closing AMQP connection &lt;0.882.0&gt; (127.0.0.1:49911 -&gt; 127.0.0.1:5672):
failed to negotiate connection parameters: negotiated channel_max = 2047 is higher than the maximum allowed value (32)
</pre>


## <a id="monitoring" class="anchor" href="#monitoring">Monitoring, Metrics and Diagnostics</a>

Number of currently open channels and channel opening/closure rates are important metrics
of the system that should be [monitored](/monitoring.html). Monitoring them will help detect a number of
common problems:

 * Channel leaks
 * High channel churn

Both problems eventually lead to node exhaustion of [resources](#resource-usage).

Individual channel metrics such as the number of [unacknowledged messages](/confirms.html#acknowledgement-modes)
or `basic.get` operation rate can help identify irregularities and inefficiencies
in application behavior.

### <a id="memory-use" class="anchor" href="#memory-use">Memory Use</a>

[Monitoring systems](/monitoring.html) and operators alike may need to inspect how much memory
channels consume on a node, the total
number of channels on a node and then identify how many there are on each connection.

The number of channels is displayed in the [management UI](/management.html) on the Overview tab,
as is the [number of connections](/connections.html#monitoring).
By dividing the number of channels by the number of connections
the operator can detemine an average number of channels per connection.

To find out how much memory on a node is used by channels, use [`rabbitmq-diagnostics memory_breakdown`](/rabbitmq-diagnostics.8.html):

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmq-diagnostics memory_breakdown -q --unit mb
# => [elided for brevity]
# ...
# => connection_channels: 3.596 mb (2.27%)
# ...
# => [elided for brevity]
</pre>

See the [RabbitMQ Memory Use Analysis guide](/memory-use.html) for details.


### <a id="channel-leaks" class="anchor" href="#channel-leaks">Channel Leaks</a>

A channel leak is a condition under which an application repeatedly opens channels without closing them,
or at least closing only some of them.

Channel leaks eventually exhaust the node (or multiple target nodes) of RAM and CPU resources.

#### Relevant Metrics

Management UI's Overview tab lists a total number of channels in all virtual hosts the current
user has access to:

<img class="screenshot" src="img/monitoring/channels/mgmt-ui-global-channel-count.png" alt="Global channel count in management UI" title="Global channel count in management UI" />

To inspect the current number of channels on a connection as well as the per-connection channel limit, navigate
to the Connections tab and enable the relevant columns if they are not displayed:

<img class="screenshot" src="img/monitoring/channels/mgmt-ui-per-connection-channel-max-and-count.png" alt="Per connection channel count in management UI" title="Per connection channel count in management UI" />

Overview and individual node pages provide a chart of channel churn rate as of [RabbitMQ 3.7.9](/changelog.html).
If the rate of channel open operations is consistently higher than that of channel close operations,
this is evidence of a channel leak in one of the applications:

<img class="screenshot" src="img/monitoring/channels/mgmt-ui-channel-count-growth.png" alt="Channel count growth in management UI" title="Channel count growth in management UI" />

To find out what connection leaks channels, inspect per-connection channel count as demonstrated in this guide.


### <a id="high-channel-churn" class="anchor" href="#high-channel-churn">High Channel Churn</a>

A system is said to have high channel churn when its rate of newly opened channels is consistently high and
its rate of closed channels is consistently high. This usually means that an application
uses short lived channels or channels are often closed due to channel-level exceptions.

While with some workloads this is a natural state of the system,
long lived channels should be used instead when possible.

[Management UI](/management.html) provides a chart of channel churn rate.
Below is a chart that demonstrates a fairly low channel churn with a virtually identical number of channel open and closed
in the given period of time:

<img class="screenshot" src="img/monitoring/channels/mgmt-ui-node-channel-churn.png" alt="Node channel churn in management UI" title="Node channel churn in management UI" />

While connection and disconnection rates are system-specific, rates consistently above 100/second likely indicate a suboptimal
connection management by one or more applications and usually are worth investigating.

<img class="screenshot" src="img/monitoring/channels/mgmt-ui-high-channel-churn.png" alt="High channel churn in management UI" title="High channel churn in management UI" />

Note that some clients and runtimes (notably PHP) do not use long-lived connections and high connection
churn rates are expected from them unless a [specialized proxy is used](https://github.com/cloudamqp/amqproxy).

### <a id="inspect-in-management-ui" class="anchor" href="#inspect-in-management-ui">Inspecting Channels and Their State Using CLI Tools</a>

To inspect channels in the management UI, navigate to the Channels tab and add or remove columns
as needed:

<img class="screenshot" src="img/monitoring/channels/mgmt-ui-channel-list.png" alt="High channel churn in management UI" title="High channel churn in management UI" />

### <a id="inspect-using-cli-tools" class="anchor" href="#inspect-using-cli-tools">Inspecting Channels and Their State Using CLI Tools</a>

[`rabbitmqctl list_connections`](/rabbitmqctl.8.html) and [`rabbitmqctl list_channels`](/rabbitmqctl.8.html) are the
primary commands for inspecting per-connection channel count and channel details such as the number of
consumers, [unacknowledged messages](/confirms.html#acknowledgement-modes), [prefetch](/confirms.html#channel-qos-prefetch) and so on.

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl list_connections name channels -q
# =&gt; name	channels
# =&gt; 127.0.0.1:52956 -&gt; 127.0.0.1:5672	10
# =&gt; 127.0.0.1:52964 -&gt; 127.0.0.1:5672	33
</pre>

The rightmost column contains channel count on the connection.

Table headers can be suppressed:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl list_connections name channels -q --no-table-headers
# =&gt; 127.0.0.1:52956 -&gt; 127.0.0.1:5672	10
# =&gt; 127.0.0.1:52964 -&gt; 127.0.0.1:5672	33
</pre>

To inspect individual channels, use [`rabbitmqctl list_channels`](/rabbitmqctl.8.html):

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl list_channels -q
# =&gt; pid	user	consumer_count	messages_unacknowledged
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.815.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.820.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.824.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.828.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.832.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.839.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.840.0&gt;	guest	0	0
</pre>

Table headers can be suppressed:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl list_channels -q --no-table-headers
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.815.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.820.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.824.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.828.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.832.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.839.0&gt;	guest	0	0
# =&gt; &lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.840.0&gt;	guest	0	0
</pre>

It is possible to display a different set of columns:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl list_channels -q --no-table-headers vhost connection number  prefetch_count messages_unconfirmed
# =&gt; /	&lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.799.0&gt;	1	0	0

</pre>

<pre class="lang-bash">

# =&gt; /	&lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.802.0&gt;	4	false
# =&gt; /	&lt;rabbit@mercurio.3.799.0&gt;	5	false
</pre>


## <a id="flow-control" class="anchor" href="#flow-control">Publisher Flow Control</a>

Channels that publish messages can outpace other parts of the system, most likely busy queues and queues
that perform replication. When that happens, [flow control](/flow-control.html) is applied to
publishing channels and, in turn, connections. Channels and connections that only consume messages
are not affected.

With slower consumers that use [automatic acknowledgement mode](/confirms.html#acknowledgement-modes)
it is very likely that connections and channels will experience flow control when writing to
the TCP socket.

[Monitoring](/monitoring.html) systems can collect metrics on the number of connections in flow state.
Applications that experience flow control regularly may consider to use separate connections
to publish and consume to avoid flow control effects on non-publishing operations (e.g. queue management).

    <title>Consumer Priorities</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="intro">
      Consumer priorities allow you to ensure that high priority
      consumers receive messages while they are active, with messages
      only going to lower priority consumers when the high priority
      consumers block.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally, active consumers connected to a queue receive messages
      from it in a round-robin fashion. When consumer priorities are
      in use, messages are delivered round-robin if multiple active
      consumers exist with the same high priority.
    </p>

    <h3>Definition of active consumers</h3>

    <p>
      The above paragraphs refer to consumers as being <i>active</i>
      or <i>blocked</i>. At any moment, any given consumer is either
      one or the other. An active consumer is one which could receive
      a message without waiting. A consumer becomes blocked if it
      cannot receive messages - because its channel has reached the
      maximum number of unacknowledged messages after issuing
      <code>basic.qos</code>, or simply because of network congestion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore for each queue, at least one of three things must be true:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>There are no active consumers</li>
      <li>The queue is empty</li>
      <li>The queue is busy delivering messages to consumers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Note that consumers can switch between active and blocked many
      times per second. We therefore don't expose whether a consumer
      is active or blocked through the management plugin or
      <code>rabbitmqctl</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When consumer priorities are in use, you can expect your highest
      priority consumers to receive all the messages until they become
      blocked, at which point lower priority consumers will start to
      receive some. It's important to understand that RabbitMQ will
      still prioritise delivering messages - it will not wait for a
      high priority blocked consumer to become unblocked if there is
      an active lower priority consumer ready.
    </p>

    <h3>Using consumer priorities</h3>

    <p>
      Set the <code>x-priority</code> argument in the
      <code>basic.consume</code> method to an integer value. Consumers
      which do not specify a value have priority 0. Larger numbers
      indicate higher priority, and both positive and negative numbers
      can be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example (in Java):
    </p>

      <pre class="sourcecode java">
Channel channel = ...;
Consumer consumer = ...;
Map&lt;String, Object> args = new HashMap&lt;String, Object>();
args.put("x-priority", 10);
channel.basicConsume("my-queue", false, args, consumer);</pre>

    <p>
      This creates a new consumer with priority 10.
    </p>

    <title>Installing on Solaris</title>

  <body>
    <p>
      The <a href="install-generic-unix.html">Generic Unix or
      Linux</a> installation instructions may be used to install
      RabbitMQ on Solaris, with two modifications:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The RabbitMQ shell scripts assume a standard POSIX environment.
          On Solaris this requires that startup scripts be executed with
          the <code>/usr/xpg4/bin/sh</code> shell. This can
          be accomplished by replacing the first line of each script
          (which normally reads <code>#!/bin/sh</code>) with
          <code>#!/bin/xpg4/bin/sh</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The RabbitMQ shell scripts assume the existence of the
          "readlink" utility for resolving symbolic links. This can be
          obtained by installing the
          <a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/">Sunfreeware</a>
          "coreutils" package or compiling
          <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">GNU
            coreutils</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Undeprecated Features</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to extensions beyond the specification, RabbitMQ
        also undeprecates some features that were removed from AMQP
         0-9-1.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#exchange.declare.auto-delete">Auto-delete exchanges</a></li>
        <li><a href="amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#exchange.declare.internal">Internal exchanges</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The access class was deprecated from AMQP 0-9-1. RabbitMQ
        implements the
        <code>access.request</code> method from this class as a no-op
        in order to maintain compatibility with older clients. This
        method will be removed in the future and should not be relied
        upon.
      </p>

    <h2>amq.* Exchange Immutability</h2>
      <p>
        AMQP 0-9-1 spec dictates that it must not be possible to declare an exchange
        with the <code>amq.</code> prefix. RabbitMQ also prohibits deletion of such exchanges.

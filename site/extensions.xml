      <p class="intro">
        The RabbitMQ Server implements a number of extensions of the
        <a href="specification.html">AMQP specification</a>, which we
        document here.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="confirms.html">Confirms</a> (aka Publisher

      <h2>Consuming</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="consumer-cancel.html">Consumer Cancellation
          Notifications</a> let a consumer know if it has been
          cancelled by the server.

        <li>
          <a href="nack.html"><code>basic.nack</code></a>

          multiple messages at once.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="direct-reply-to.html">Fast reply-to</a> allows RPC
          clients to receive replies to their queries without needing
          to declare a temporary queue.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="landing-box">
      <h2>Message Routing</h2>

      <ul>

          routing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="ae.html">Alternate Exchanges</a> route messages
          that were otherwise unroutable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="sender-selected.html">Sender-selected
          Distribution</a> allows a publisher to decide where messages
          are routed directly.
        </li>
      </ul>

          it is automatically deleted.

        <li>
          <a href="ttl.html#per-message-ttl">Per-Message TTL</a>

        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="ttl.html#queue-ttl">Queue TTL</a> determines how
          long an unused queue can live before it is automatically
          deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="dlx.html">Dead Letter Exchanges</a> ensure messages
          get re-routed when they are rejected or expire.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="maxlength.html">Length Limit</a>
          allows the maximum length of a queue to be set.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="priority.html">Priority Queues</a>
          support the AMQP message priority field (in a slightly

          The <a href="validated-user-id.html">User-ID</a> message
          property is validated by the server.
        </li>

        <li>
          Clients that advertise the appropriate capability may receive
          explicit <a href="auth-notification.html">authentication failure notifications</a>
          from the broker.

      <h2>AMQP 0-9-1 Spec Differences</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some features that were in AMQP 0-8 were deprecated in AMQP
          0-9-1. We have undeprecated some of them and introduced a
          couple of tiny behaviour changes that improve usability of
          the product. Please refer to the <a href="spec-differences.html">spec differences</a> page.
        </li>

# RabbitMQ JMS Client

## <a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction">Introduction</a>

RabbitMQ JMS Client is a client library for Pivotal RabbitMQ.
RabbitMQ is not a JMS provider but includes [a
plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jms-topic-exchange)
needed to support the JMS Queue and Topic messaging models. JMS Client
for RabbitMQ implements the JMS 1.1 specification on top of the
[RabbitMQ Java client](/api-guide.html), thus allowing new and
existing JMS applications to connect to RabbitMQ.

The plugin and the JMS client are meant to work and be used together.

## <a id="components" class="anchor" href="#components">Components</a>

To fully leverage JMS with RabbitMQ, you need the following components:

 * the [JMS client library](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jms-client) and its dependent libraries.
 * [RabbitMQ JMS topic selector plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jms-topic-exchange) that is included
   with RabbitMQ starting with version 3.6.3. To support message selectors for JMS
   topics, the RabbitMQ Topic Selector plugin must be installed on the
   RabbitMQ server. Message selectors allow a JMS application to filter
   messages using an expression based on SQL syntax. Message selectors
   for Queues are not currently supported.

## <a id="jms-amqp" class="anchor" href="#jms-amqp">JMS and AMQP 0-9-1</a>

JMS is the standard messaging API for the JEE platform. It is
available in commercial and open source implementations.  Each
implementation includes a JMS provider, a JMS client library, and
additional, implementation-specific components for administering the
messaging system. The JMS provider can be a standalone implementation
of the messaging service, or a bridge to a non-JMS messaging system.

The JMS client API is standardized, so JMS applications are portable
between vendors’ implementations. However, the underlying messaging
implementation is unspecified, so there is no interoperability between
JMS implementations. Java applications that want to share messaging
must all use the same JMS implementation unless bridging technology
exists. Furthermore, non-Java applications cannot access JMS without a
vendor-specific JMS client library to enable interoperability.

AMQP 0-9-1 is a messaging protocol, rather than an API like JMS. Any
client that implements the protocol can access a broker that supports
AMQP 0-9-1. Protocol-level interoperability allows AMQP 0-9-1 clients
written in any programming language and running on any operating
system to participate in the messaging system with no need to bridge
incompatible vendor implementations.

Because JMS Client for RabbitMQ is implemented using the RabbitMQ Java
client, it is compliant with both the JMS API and the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol.

You can download the JMS 1.1 specification and API documentation from
the [Oracle Technology Network Web site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/docs-136352.html).

## <a id="limitations" class="anchor" href="#limitations">Limitations</a>

Some JMS 1.1 features are unsupported in the RabbitMQ JMS Client:

 * The JMS Client does not support server sessions.
 * XA transaction support interfaces are not implemented.
 * Topic selectors are supported with the RabbitMQ JMS topic selector
 plugin. Queue selectors are not yet implemented.
 * SSL and socket options for RabbitMQ connections are supported, but
 only using the (default) SSL connection protocols that the RabbitMQ client provides.
 * The JMS `NoLocal` subscription feature, which prevents delivery of
 messages published from a subscriber’s own connection, is not supported
 with RabbitMQ. You can call a method that includes the `NoLocal`
 argument, but it is ignored.

See [the JMS API compliance documentation](jms-client-compliance.html) for a
detailed list of supported JMS APIs.

## <a id="installing-configuring" class="anchor" href="#installing-configuring">Installing and Configuring</a>

### <a id="plugin" class="anchor" href="#plugin">Enabling the Topic Selector Plug-in</a>

The topic selector plugin is included with RabbitMQ. Like any RabbitMQ
plugin, you need to enable the plugin in order to use it.

Enable the plugin using the `rabbitmq-plugins` command:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_jms_topic_exchange
</pre>

You don't need to restart the broker to activate the plugin.

***You need to enable this plugin only if you plan to use topic selectors
in your JMS client applications***.

### <a id="java-container" class="anchor" href="#java-container">Enabling the JMS client in a Java container</a>

To enable the JMS Client in a Java container (e.g. Java EE application
server, web container), you must install the JMS client JAR files and
its dependencies in the container and then define JMS resources in
the container’s naming system so that JMS clients can look them up.
The methods for accomplishing these tasks are container-specific, please
refer to the vendors’ documentation.

For standalone applications, you need to add the JMS client JAR files
and its dependencies to the application classpath. The JMS resources
can be defined programmatically or through a dependency injection
framework like Spring.

### <a id="jms-connection-factory" class="anchor" href="#jms-connection-factory">Defining the JMS Connection Factory</a>

To define the JMS `ConnectionFactory` in JNDI, e.g. in Tomcat:

<pre class="lang-xml">
&lt;Resource name="jms/ConnectionFactory"
            type="javax.jms.ConnectionFactory"
         factory="com.rabbitmq.jms.admin.RMQObjectFactory"
        username="guest"
        password="guest"
     virtualHost="/"
            host="localhost"
            port="5672"/&gt;
</pre>

To define the JMS `ConnectionFactory` in JNDI, e.g. in WildFly (as of JMS Client 1.7.0):

<pre class="lang-xml">
&lt;object-factory name=&quot;java:global/jms/ConnectionFactory&quot;
                   module=&quot;org.jboss.genericjms.provider&quot;
                   class=&quot;com.rabbitmq.jms.admin.RMQObjectFactory&quot;&gt;
     &lt;environment&gt;
         &lt;property name=&quot;className&quot; value=&quot;javax.jms.ConnectionFactory&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;property name=&quot;username&quot; value=&quot;guest&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;property name=&quot;password&quot; value=&quot;guest&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;property name=&quot;virtualHost&quot; value=&quot;/&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;property name=&quot;host&quot; value=&quot;localhost&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;property name=&quot;port&quot; value="5672"/&gt;
     &lt;/environment&gt;
&lt;/object-factory&gt;
</pre>

Here is the equivalent Spring bean example (Java configuration):

<pre class="lang-java">
@Bean
public ConnectionFactory jmsConnectionFactory() {
  RMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new RMQConnectionFactory();
  connectionFactory.setUsername("guest");
  connectionFactory.setPassword("guest");
  connectionFactory.setVirtualHost("/");
  connectionFactory.setHost("localhost");
  connectionFactory.setPort(5672);
  return connectionFactory;
}
</pre>

And here is the Spring XML configuration:

<pre class="lang-xml">
&lt;bean id="jmsConnectionFactory" class="com.rabbitmq.jms.admin.RMQConnectionFactory" &gt;
  &lt;property name="username" value="guest" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="password" value="guest" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="virtualHost" value="/" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="host" value="localhost" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="port" value="5672" /&gt;      
&lt;/bean&gt;
</pre>

The following table lists all of the attributes/properties that are available.

## <a id="destination-interoperability" class="anchor" href="#destination-interoperability">JMS and AMQP 0-9-1 Destination Interoperability</a>

An interoperability feature allows you to define JMS 'amqp' destinations
that read and/or write to non-JMS RabbitMQ resources. ***Note this feature
does not support JMS topics***.

A single 'amqp' destination can be defined for both sending and consuming.

### Sending JMS Messages to an AMQP Exchange

A JMS destination can be defined so that a JMS application can send
`Message`s to a predefined RabbitMQ 'destination' (exchange/routing key)
using the JMS API in the normal way. The messages are written
"in the clear," which means that any AMQP 0-9-1 client can read them without
having to understand the internal format of Java JMS messages.
***Only `BytesMessage`s and `TextMessage`s can be written in this way***.

When messages are sent to an 'amqp' Destination, JMS message properties
are mapped onto AMQP 0-9-1 headers and properties as appropriate.
For example, the `JMSPriority` property converts to the `priority` property
for the AMQP 0-9-1 message. (It is also set as a header with the name
"JMSPriority".) User-defined properties are set as named message header
values, provided they are `boolean`, numeric or `String` types.

### Consuming Messages From an AMQP Queue

Similarly, a JMS destination can be defined that reads messages from a
predefined RabbitMQ queue. A JMS application can then read these
messages using the JMS API. RabbitMQ JMS Client packs them up into
JMS Messages automatically. Messages read in this way are, by default,
`BytesMessage`s, but individual messages can be marked `TextMessage`
(by adding an AMQP message header called "JMSType" whose value is
"TextMessage"), which will interpret the byte-array payload as a UTF8
encoded String and return them as `TextMessage`s.

When reading from an 'amqp' Destination, values are mapped back to
JMS message properties, except that any explicit JMS property set as
a message header overrides the natural AMQP 0-9-1 header value, unless
this would misrepresent the message. For example,
`JMSDeliveryMode` cannot be overridden in this way.

### JMS 'amqp' `RMQDestination` Constructor

The `com.rabbitmq.jms.admin` package contains the `RMQDestination` class,
which implements `Destination` in the JMS interface. This is extended
with a new constructor:

<pre class="lang-java">
    public RMQDestination(String destinationName, String amqpExchangeName,
                          String amqpRoutingKey, String amqpQueueName);
</pre>

This constructor creates a destination for JMS for RabbitMQ mapped
onto an AMQP 0-9-1 resource. The parameters are the following:

 * `destinationName` - the name of the queue destination
 * `amqpExchangeName` - the exchange name for the mapped resource
 * `amqpRoutingKey` - the routing key for the mapped resource
 * `amqpQueueName` - the queue name of the mapped resource (to listen
 messages from)

Applications that declare destinations in this way can use them directly,
or store them in a JNDI provider for JMS applications to retrieve.
Such destinations are non-temporary, queue destinations.

### JMS AMQP 0-9-1 Destination Definitions

The `RMQDestination` object has the following new instance fields:

 * `amqp` – *boolean*, indicates if this is an AMQP 0-9-1 destination
 (if **true**); the default is **false**.
 * `amqpExchangeName` – *String*, the RabbitMQ exchange name to use when
 sending messages to this destination, if `amqp` is **true**; the default
 is **null**.
 * `amqpRoutingKey` – *String*, the AMQP 0-9-1 routing key to use when sending
 messages to this destination, if `amqp` is **true**; the default is **null**.
 * `amqpQueueName` – *String*, the RabbitMQ queue name to use when reading
 messages from this destination, if `amqp` is **true**; the default is **null**.

There are getters and setters for these fields, which means that a JNDI
 `<Resource/>` definition or an XML Spring bean definition can use them, for example
 JNDI with Tomcat:

<pre class="lang-xml">
    &lt;Resource  name="jms/Queue"
               type="javax.jms.Queue"
            factory="com.rabbitmq.jms.admin.RMQObjectFactory"
    destinationName="myQueue"
               amqp="true"
      amqpQueueName="rabbitQueueName"
    /&gt;
</pre>

This is the equivalent with WildFly (as of JMS Client 1.7.0):

<pre class="lang-xml">
&lt;bindings&gt;
    &lt;object-factory name="java:global/jms/Queue"
                    module="foo.bar"
                    class="com.rabbitmq.jms.admin.RMQObjectFactory"&gt;
        &lt;environment&gt;
            &lt;property name="className" value="javax.jms.Queue"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="destinationName" value="myQueue"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="amqp" value="true"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="amqpQueueName" value="rabbitQueueName"/&gt;
        &lt;/environment&gt;
    &lt;/object-factory&gt;
&lt;/bindings&gt;
</pre>

This is the equivalent Spring bean example (Java configuration):

<pre class="lang-java">
    @Bean
    public Destination jmsDestination() {
        RMQDestination jmsDestination = new RMQDestination();
        jmsDestination.setDestinationName("myQueue");
        jmsDestination.setAmqp(true);
        jmsDestination.setAmqpQueueName("rabbitQueueName");
        return jmsDestination;
    }
</pre>

And here is the Spring XML configuration:

<pre class="lang-xml">
    &lt;bean id="jmsDestination" class="com.rabbitmq.jms.admin.RMQDestination" &gt;
     &lt;property name="destinationName" value="myQueue" /&gt;
     &lt;property name="amqp"            value="true" /&gt;
     &lt;property name="amqpQueueName"   value="rabbitQueueName" /&gt;
    &lt;/bean&gt;
</pre>

## <a id="logging" class="anchor" href="#logging">Configuring Logging for the JMS Client</a>

The JMS Client logs messages using SLF4J (Simple Logging Façade for Java).
SLF4J delegates to a logging framework, such as Apache Logback.
If no other logging framework is
enabled, SLF4J defaults to a built-in, no-op, logger.
See the [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/docs.html) documentation for a
list of the logging frameworks SLF4J supports.

The target logging framework is configured at deployment time by adding
an SLF4J binding for the framework to the classpath.
For example, the Logback SLF4J binding is in the
`logback-classic-{version}.jar` file.
To direct JMS client log messages to Logback, for example,
add the following JARs to the classpath:

 * [slf4j-api-1.7.25.jar](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/slf4j/slf4j-api/1.7.25/slf4j-api-1.7.25.jar)
 * [logback-core-1.2.3.jar](http://central.maven.org/maven2/ch/qos/logback/logback-core/1.2.3/logback-core-1.2.3.jar)
 * [logback-classic-1.2.3.jar](http://central.maven.org/maven2/ch/qos/logback/logback-classic/1.2.3/logback-classic-1.2.3.jar)

We highly recommend to use a dependency management tool like [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.

The SLF4J API is backwards compatible, so you can use use any version of
SLF4J. Version 1.7.5 or higher is recommended. The SLF4J API and
bindings, however, must be from the same SLF4J version.

No additional SLF4J configuration is required, once the API and
binding JAR files are in the classpath. However, the target framework
may have configuration files or command-line options.
Refer to the documentation for the target logging framework
for configuration details.

## <a id="rpc-support" class="anchor" href="#rpc-support">Support for Request/Reply (a.k.a. RPC)</a>

It is possible to use JMS for synchronous request/reply use cases.
This pattern is commonly known as *Remote Procedure Call* or *RPC*.

### With JMS API

An RPC client can be implemented in pure JMS like the following:

<pre class="lang-java">
Message request = ... // create the request message
// set up reply-to queue and start listening on it
Destination replyQueue = session.createTemporaryQueue();
message.setJMSReplyTo(replyQueue);
MessageConsumer responseConsumer = session.createConsumer(replyQueue);
BlockingQueue&lt;Message&gt; queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;&gt;(1);
responseConsumer.setMessageListener(msg -> queue.add(msg));
// send request message
MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer("request.queue");
producer.send(request);
// wait response for 5 seconds
Message response = queue.poll(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
// close the response consumer
responseConsumer.close();
</pre>

It's also possible to create a single reply-to destination instead of
a temporary destination for each request. This is more efficient but requires
to properly correlate the response with the request, by using e.g.
a correlation ID header. RabbitMQ's [direct reply-to](direct-reply-to.html)
is another alternative (see below).

Note this sample uses a `MessageListener` and a `BlockingQueue` to wait
for the response. This implies a network roundtrip to register an AMQP
consumer and another one to close the consumer.
`MessageConsumer#receive` could have been used as well, in this case the JMS
client internally polls the reply destination to get the response, which can result in several
network roundtrips if the response takes some time to come. The request
call will also incur a constant penalty equals to the polling interval (100 milliseconds
by default).

The server part looks like the following:

<pre class="lang-java">
// this is necessary when using temporary reply-to destinations
connectionFactory.setDeclareReplyToDestination(false);
...
MessageProducer replyProducer = session.createProducer(null);
MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer("request.queue");
consumer.setMessageListener(message -> {
    try {
        Destination replyQueue = message.getJMSReplyTo();
        if (replyQueue != null) {
            // create response and send it
            Message response = ...
            replyProducer.send(replyQueue, response);
        }
    } catch (JMSException e) {
        // deal with exception
    }
});
</pre>

Note the `connectionFactory.setDeclareReplyToDestination(false)`
statement: it is necessary when using temporary reply-to destinations.
If this flag is not set to `false` on the RPC server side, the JMS
client will try to re-create the temporary reply-to destination, which will
interfere with the client-side declaration.

See [this test](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jms-client/blob/master/src/test/java/com/rabbitmq/integration/tests/RpcIT.java)
for a full RPC example.

The JMS client also supports [direct reply-to](direct-reply-to.html), which is faster as it doesn't imply
creating a temporary reply destination:

<pre class="lang-java">
Message request = ...
// use direct reply-to
RMQDestination replyQueue = new RMQDestination(
    "amq.rabbitmq.reply-to", "", "amq.rabbitmq.reply-to", "amq.rabbitmq.reply-to"
);
replyQueue.setDeclared(true); // don't need to create this destination
message.setJMSReplyTo(replyQueue);
MessageConsumer responseConsumer = session.createConsumer(replyQueue);
BlockingQueue&lt;Message&gt; queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;&gt;(1);
responseConsumer.setMessageListener(msg -> queue.add(msg));
// send request message
MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer("request.queue");
producer.send(request);
// wait response for 5 seconds
Message response = queue.poll(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
// close the response consumer
responseConsumer.close();
</pre>

Using direct reply-to for JMS-based RPC has the following implications:

 * it uses automatically auto-acknowledgment
 * the response must be a `BytesMessage` or a `TextMessage` as direct reply-to
 is considered an [AMQP destination](#destination-interoperability). Use `response.setStringProperty("JMSType", "TextMessage")`
 on the response message in the RPC server if you want to receive a `TextMessage`
 on the client side.

See [this test](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jms-client/blob/master/src/test/java/com/rabbitmq/integration/tests/RpcWithAmqpDirectReplyIT.java) for a full RPC example using direct reply-to.

### With Spring JMS

[Spring JMS](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.1.0.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#jms)
is a popular way to work with JMS as it avoids most of JMS boilerplate.

The following sample shows how a client can perform RPC with the
`JmsTemplate`:

<pre class="lang-java">
// NB: do not create a new JmsTemplate for each request
JmsTemplate tpl = new JmsTemplate(connectionFactory);
tpl.setReceiveTimeout(5000);
Message response = tpl.sendAndReceive(
    "request.queue",
    session -> ... // create request message in MessageCreator
);
</pre>

This is no different from any other JMS client.

The `JmsTemplate` uses a temporary reply-to destination,
so the call to `connectionFactory.setDeclareReplyToDestination(false)`
on the RPC server side is necessary, just like with regular JMS.

RPC with direct reply-to
must be implemented with a `SessionCallback`, as the reply destination
must be explicitly declared:

<pre class="lang-java">
// NB: do not create a new JmsTemplate for each request
JmsTemplate tpl = new JmsTemplate(connectionFactory);
Message response = tpl.execute(session -> {
    Message request = ... // create request message
    // setup direct reply-to as reply-to destination
    RMQDestination replyQueue = new RMQDestination(
        "amq.rabbitmq.reply-to", "", "amq.rabbitmq.reply-to", "amq.rabbitmq.reply-to"
    );
    replyQueue.setDeclared(true); // don't need to create this destination
    message.setJMSReplyTo(replyQueue);
    MessageConsumer responseConsumer = session.createConsumer(replyQueue);
    BlockingQueue&lt;Message&gt; queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;&gt;(1);
    responseConsumer.setMessageListener(msg -> queue.add(msg));
    // send request message
    MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(session.createQueue("request.queue"));
    producer.send(message);
    try {
        // wait response for 5 seconds
        Message response = queue.poll(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        // close the response consumer
        responseConsumer.close();
        return response;
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // deal with exception
    }
});
</pre>

See [this test](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jms-client/blob/master/src/test/java/com/rabbitmq/integration/tests/RpcSpringJmsIT.java)
for a full example of RPC with Spring JMS, including using a `@JmsListener` bean
for the server part.

## <a id="implementation-details" class="anchor" href="#implementation-details">Implementation Details</a>

This section provides additional implementation details for specific
JMS API classes in the JMS Client.

Deviations from the specification are implemented to support common
acknowledgement behaviours.

## <a id="jms_topic_support"></a>JMS Topic Support

JMS topics are implemented using an AMQP [topic exchange](tutorials/amqp-concepts.html#exchange-topic)
and a dedicated AMQP queue for each JMS topic subscriber. The AMQP
topic exchange is `jms.temp.topic` or `jms.durable.topic`, depending
on whether the JMS topic is temporary or not, respectively. Let's
take an example with a subscription to a durable `my.jms.topic` JMS topic:

 * a dedicated AMQP queue is created for this subscriber, its name
 will follow the pattern `jms-cons-{UUID}`.
 * the `jms-cons-{UUID}` AMQP queue is bound to the `jms.durable.topic`
 exchange with the `my.jms.topic` binding key.

If another subscriber subscribes to `my.jms.topic`, it will have
its own AMQP queue and both subscribers will receive messages published
to the `jms.durable.topic` exchange with the `my.jms.topic` routing key.

The example above assumes no topic selector is used when declaring the
subscribers. If a topic selector is in use, a `x-jms-topic`-typed exchange
will sit between the `jms.durable.topic` topic exchange and the
subscriber queue. So the topology is the following when subscribing to
a durable `my.jms.topic` JMS topic with a selector:

 * a dedicated AMQP queue is created for this subscriber, its name
 will follow the pattern `jms-cons-{UUID}`.
 * a `x-jms-topic`-typed exchange is bound to the subscriber AMQP queue with
 the `my.jms.topic` binding key and some arguments related to the selector
 expressions. Note this exchange is scoped to the JMS session and not only
 to the subscriber.
 * the `x-jms-topic`-typed exchange is bound to the `jms.durable.topic`
 exchange with the `my.jms.topic` binding key.

Exchanges can be bound together thanks to a [RabbitMQ extension](e2e.html).
Note the [topic selector plugin](#plugin) must be enabled for topic selectors
to work.

## <a id="queue_browser_support"></a>QueueBrowser Support

### Overview of queue browsers

The JMS API includes objects and methods to browse an existing queue
destination, reading its messages *without* removing them from the
queue. Topic destinations cannot be browsed in this manner.

A `QueueBrowser` can be created from a (queue) `Destination`,
with or without a selector expression. The browser has a `getEnumeration()`
method, which returns a Java `Enumeration` of `Message`s copied from
the queue.

If no selector is supplied, then all messages in the queue appear
in the `Enumeration`. If a selector is supplied, then only those
messages that satisfy the selector appear.

### Implementation

The destination queue is read when the `getEnumeration()` method is
called. A *snapshot* is taken of the messages in the queue; and the
selector expression, if one is supplied, is used at this time to discard
messages that do not match.

The message copies may now be read using the `Enumeration` interface
(`nextElement()` and `hasMoreElements()`).

The selector expression and the destination queue of the `QueueBrowser`
may not be adjusted after the `QueueBrowser` is created.

An `Enumeration` cannot be "reset", but the `getEnumeration()` method
may be re-issued, taking a *new* snapshot from the queue each time.

The contents of an `Enumeration` survive session and/or connection
close, but a `QueueBrowser` may not be used after the session that
created it has closed. `QueueBrowser.close()` has no effect.

#### Which messages are included

Messages that arrive, expire, are re-queued, or are removed after
the `getEnumeration()` call have no effect on the contents of the
`Enumeration` it produced. If the messages in the queue change
*while the* `Enumeration` *is being built*, they may or may not be
included. In particular, if messages from the queue are simultaneously
read by another client (or session), they may or may not appear in
the `Enumeration`.

Message copies do not "expire" from an `Enumeration`.

#### Order of messages

If other client sessions read from a queue that is being browsed,
then it is possible that some messages may subsequently be received out
of order.

Message order will not be disturbed if no other client sessions read
the queue at the same time.

#### Memory usage

When a message is read from the `Enumeration` (with `nextElement()`),
then no reference to it is retained in the Java Client. This means the
storage it occupies in the client is eligible for release
(by garbage collection) if no other references are retained.
Retaining an `Enumeration` will retain the storage for all message
copies that remain in it.

If the queue has many messages -- or the messages it contains are very
large -- then a `getEnumeration()` method call may consume a large
amount of memory in a very short time. This remains true even if only
a few messages are selected. There is currently limited protection
against `OutOfMemoryError` conditions that may arise because of this.
See the next section.

#### Setting a maximum number of messages to browse

Each connection is created with a limit on the number of messages that
are examined by a `QueueBrowser`. The limit is set on the
`RMQConnectionFactory` by `RMQConnectionFactory.setQueueBrowserReadMax(int)`
and is passed to each `Connection` subsequently created
by `ConnectionFactory.createConnection()`.

The limit is an integer that, if positive, stops the queue browser from
reading more than this number of messages when building an enumeration.
If it is zero or negative, it is interpreted as imposing no limit on
the browser, and all of the messages on the queue are scanned.

The default limit for a factory is determined by the
`rabbit.jms.queueBrowserReadMax` system property, if set, and the value
is specified as `0` if this property is not set or is not an integer.

If a `RMQConnectionFactory` value is obtained from a JNDI provider,
then the limit set when the factory object was created is preserved.

#### Release Support

Support for `QueueBrowser`s is introduced in the JMS Client 1.2.0.
Prior to that release, calling `Session.createBrowser(Queue queue[, String selector])`
resulted in an `UnsupportedOperationException`.

### Group and individual acknowledgement

Prior to version 1.2.0 of the JMS client, in client acknowledgement mode
(`Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE`), acknowledging any message from an open
session would acknowledge *every* unacknowledged message of that session,
whether they were received before or after the message being acknowledged.

Currently, the behaviour of `Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE` mode is
modified so that, when calling `msg.acknowledge()`, only the message
`msg` *and all* previously received *unacknowledged messages on that
session* are acknowledged. Messages received *after* `msg` was received
are not affected. This is a form of *group acknowledgement*,
which differs slightly from the JMS 1.1 specification but is likely to
be more useful, and is compatible with the vast majority of uses of
the existing acknowledge function.

For even finer control, a new acknowledgement mode may be set when
creating a session, called `RMQSession.CLIENT_INDIVIDUAL_ACKNOWLEDGE`.

A session created with this acknowledgement mode will mean that messages
received on that session will be acknowledged individually. That is,
the call `msg.acknowledge()` will acknowledge only the message `msg`
and not affect any other messages of that session.

The acknowledgement mode `RMQSession.CLIENT_INDIVIDUAL_ACKNOWLEDGE`
is equivalent to `Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE` in all other respects.
In particular the `getAcknowledgeMode()` method returns
`Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE` even if
`RMQSession.CLIENT_INDIVIDUAL_ACKNOWLEDGE` has been set.

### Arbitrary Message support

Any instance of a class that implements the `javax.jms.Message`
interface can be *sent* by a JMS message producer.

All properties of the message required by `send()` are correctly
interpreted except that the `JMSReplyTo` header and objects
(as property values or the body of an `ObjectMessage`) that
cannot be deserialized are ignored.

The implementation extracts the properties and body from the `Message`
instance using interface methods and recreates it as a message of
the right (`RMQMessage`) type (`BytesMessage`, `MapMessage`, `ObjectMessage`,
`TextMessage`, or `StreamMessage`) before sending it. This means
that there is some performance loss due to the copying; but in the
normal case, when the message is an instance of
`com.rabbitmq.jms.client.RMQMessage`, no copying is done.

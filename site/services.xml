      Pivotal provides a full range of commercial support and services for
      RabbitMQ.
    </p>
    <h3>Support, Training and Consulting</h3>
    <p>
      You can purchase <strong>commercial support agreements</strong> for the
      most recent open source release RabbitMQ. Alternatively, Pivotal includes
      RabbitMQ as part of the <em>vFabric&#8482; Suite Advanced</em> for which
      commercial licenses and support are available. In both cases a range of
      SLAs are available.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer on-line and instructor-led <strong>training courses</strong>
      worldwide that cover learning messaging with AMQP, use cases and patterns
      with RabbitMQ and best practice design and architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our <strong>professional consulting services</strong> are highly flexible
      to address specific issues such as on-site troubleshooting, design review,
      deployment planning, project delivery and other value-adding services
      tailored to suit your needs.</p>

    <title>Installing with Macports</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Users of Mac OS X who do not use MacPorts or Homebrew can use
      the <a href="install-generic-unix.html">Generic Unix</a>
      installation instructions instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      A portfile for the RabbitMQ server is included
      in <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>. From the
      MacPorts home page:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The MacPorts Project is an open-source community
      initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling,
      installing, and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua
      based open-source software on the Mac OS X operating
      system.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ maintains a dedicated
      <a href="macports.html">MacPorts repository</a>, which you
      should use to install the latest RabbitMQ server version via
      MacPorts, as officially released MacPorts packaging may not
      always contain the lastest released version of RabbitMQ.<br/>
      (NB It can take a very long time to install other macport
      updates - see <code>man port</code> for options).
    </p>

    <h3>Install the Server</h3>
    <p>
      Installation of the version of the RabbitMQ server
      distributed with MacPorts is as simple as (<code>sudo port
        sync</code> followed by)
    </p>
    <pre class="sourcecode">sudo port install rabbitmq-server</pre>

    <h3>Run RabbitMQ Server</h3>
    <p>
      To start the server, you can either use launchctl (see the
      instructions emitted during the <code>sudo port
        install</code> step) or you can start it from the command
      line with <code>sudo rabbitmq-server -detached</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>rabbitmq-server</code>,
      <code>rabbitmqctl</code>, and other RabbitMQ-related
      scripts on the path automatically (through sudo) run in
      the context of the rabbitmq user, so that the Erlang cookie
      can be read from (sudo)
      <code>$MACPORTS_PREFIX/var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the <a href="install-generic-unix.html">Generic Unix or
      Linux</a> installation section for further information.

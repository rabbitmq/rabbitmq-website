    <title>Installing with Macports</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Users of Mac OS X who do not use MacPorts or Homebrew can use
      the <a href="install-standalone-mac.html">Standalone Mac OS X</a>
      installation instructions instead. Officially released MacPorts
      packages may not always contain the lastest released version of
      RabbitMQ.
    </p>
    <p>
      A portfile for the RabbitMQ server is included
      in <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>. From the
      MacPorts home page:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The MacPorts Project is an open-source community
      initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling,
      installing, and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua
      based open-source software on the Mac OS X operating
      system.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Install the Server</h3><a id="install"></a>
    <p>
      Installation of the version of the RabbitMQ server
      distributed with MacPorts is as simple as (<code>sudo port
        sync</code> followed by)
    </p>
    <pre class="sourcecode">sudo port install rabbitmq-server</pre>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> If you see messages like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="sourcecode">
*WARNING* Undefined function ssl:connection_info/1</pre>
    <p>
      when you start the server (you may need to look in the startup log
      to see these), it is probably because the Erlang port was installed
      without SSL support. If this happens, re-install the Erlang port
      with (for example):
    </p>
    <pre class="sourcecode">sudo port install erlang +ssl</pre>
    <p>
      You should not need to re-install RabbitMQ.
    </p>

    <h3>Run RabbitMQ Server</h3>
    <p>
      To start the server, you can either use launchctl (see the
      instructions emitted during the <code>sudo port
        install</code> step) or you can start it from the command
      line with <code>sudo rabbitmq-server -detached</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>rabbitmq-server</code>,
      <code>rabbitmqctl</code>, and other RabbitMQ-related
      scripts on the path automatically (through sudo) run in
      the context of the rabbitmq user, so that the Erlang cookie
      can be read from (sudo)
      <code>$MACPORTS_PREFIX/var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie</code>.

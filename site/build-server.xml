	This section describes the process for obtaining a copy of the
	RabbitMQ server source code, as well as instructions for building the

	<doc:heading>Obtaining the source</doc:heading>

        <p>
        First, obtain the source code from <a href="github.html">our GitHub repositories</a>:
	    <pre class="sourcecode bash">
git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server.git
</pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, use GNU Make to pull down dependencies and build the server:
	<pre class="sourcecode bash">
cd rabbitmq-server
make</pre>
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <xi:include href="build-erlang-prerequisites.xml.inc" />

      <doc:section name="building-server">
	<doc:heading>Building the server</doc:heading>

	<p>
	  Change to the <code>rabbitmq-server</code> directory, and
	  type <code>make</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Other interesting <code>Makefile</code> targets include
	</p>

	<p>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>all</dt>
	    <dd>
	      The default target. Builds the server.
	    </dd>

	    <dt>shell</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Builds the client libraries and starts an Erlang shell with the
	      libraries loaded.
	    </dd>

	    <dt>run-broker</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Builds the server and starts an instance with an
	      interactive Erlang shell. This will by default put
              data, including a Mnesia database, in <code>/tmp/rabbitmq-test-instances</code>,
	      but this location can be overridden by setting the
	      Makefile variable <code>TEST_TMPDIR</code>:
	      <p>
		<code>make run-broker TEST_TMPDIR=/some/other/location/for/rabbitmq-test-instances</code>
	      </p>
	      The Erlang node name can also be changed by setting
	      <code>RABBITMQ_NODENAME</code>:
	      <p>
		<code>make run-broker RABBITMQ_NODENAME=rmq</code>
	      </p>
	      See also <code>scripts/rabbitmq-env</code> for other
	      variables that may be useful.
	    </dd>

	    <dt>clean</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Removes temporary build products.
	    </dd>

	    <dt>distclean</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Removes all build products, including fetched dependencies.
	    </dd>

	    <dt>tests</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Runs a set of tests.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>

	<doc:heading>Building server packages</doc:heading>

	<p>
          In practice, building RabbitMQ server from source is of limited use
          unless an easy to deploy package (e.g. a Debian one) can be produced.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Everything related to packaging
	  the RabbitMQ server is in the
	  <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server-release">rabbitmq-server-release</a>
	  repository. Furthermore, this repository has the list of plugins
	  shipped with the broker. Please refer to the
	  <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server-release/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>
	  for instructions to create the source archive or any binary packages.

    <title>Persistence Configuration</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="intro">
      The RabbitMQ persistence layer is intended to give good results
      in the majority of situations without configuration. However,
      some configuration is sometimes useful. This page explains how
      you can configure it. You are advised to read it all before
      taking any action.
    </p>

    <h3>How persistence works</h3>

    <p>
      First, some background: both persistent and transient messages
      can be written to disk. Persistent messages will be written to
      disk as soon as they reach the queue, while transient messages
      will be written to disk only so that they can be evicted from
      memory while under memory pressure. Persistent messages are also
      kept in memory when possible and only evicted from memory under
      memory pressure. The "persistence layer" refers to the mechanism
      used to store messages of both types to disk.
    </p>

    <p>
      On this page we say "queue" to refer to an unmirrored queue or a
      queue master or a queue mirror. Queue mirroring is a "layer above"
      persistence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The persistence layer has two components: the <i>queue index</i>
      and the <i>message store</i>. The queue index is responsible for
      maintaining knowledge about where a given message is in a queue,
      along with whether it has been delivered and acknowledged. There
      is therefore one queue index per queue.
    </p>

    <p>
      The message store is a key-value store for messages, shared
      among all queues in the server. Messages (the body, and any
      properties and / or headers) can either be stored directly in
      the queue index, or written to the message store. There are
      technically two message stores (one for transient and one for
      persistent messages) but they are usually considered together as
      "the message store".
    </p>

    <h3 id="memory-costs">Memory costs</h3>

    <p>
      Under memory pressure, the persistence layer tries to write as
      much out to disk as possible, and remove as much as possible
      from memory. There are some things however which must remain in
      memory:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Each queue maintains some metadata for each
        <b>unacknowledged</b> message. The message itself can be
        removed from memory if its destination is the message store.
      </li>
      <li>
        The message store needs an index. The default message store
        index uses a small amount of memory for every message in the
        store.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="index-embedding">Messages in the queue index</h3>

    <p>
      There are advantages and disadvantages to writing messages to
      the queue index.
    </p>

    <p>Advantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Messages can be written to disk in one operation rather than
        two; for tiny messages this can be a substantial gain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Messages that are written to the queue index do not require an
        entry in the message store index and thus do not have a memory
        cost when paged out.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Disadvantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The queue index keeps blocks of a fixed number of records in
        memory; if non-tiny messages are written to the queue index then
        memory use can be substantial.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a message is routed to multiple queues by an exchange, the
        message will need to be written to multiple queue indices. If
        such a message is written to the message store, only one copy
        needs to be written.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unacknowledged messages whose destination is the queue index
        are always kept in memory.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The intent is for very small messages to be stored in the queue
      index as an optimisation, and for all other messages to be
      written to the message store. This is controlled by the
      configuration item <code>queue_index_embed_msgs_below</code>. By
      default, messages with a serialised size of less than 4096 bytes
      (including properties and headers) are stored in the queue
      index.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each queue index needs to keep at least one segment file in
      memory when reading messages from disk. The segment file
      contains records for 16,384 messages. Therefore be cautious if
      increasing <code>queue_index_embed_msgs_below</code>; a small
      increase can lead to a large amount of memory used.
    </p>

    <h2 id="limits">Accidentally limited persister performance</h2>

    <p>
      It is possible for persistence to underperform because the
      persister is limited in the number of file handles or async
      threads it has to work with. In both cases this can happen when
      you have a large number of queues which need to access the disk
      simultaneously.
    </p>

    <h3 id="file-handles">Too few file handles</h3>

    <p>
      The RabbitMQ server is typically limited in the number of file
      handles it can open (on Unix, anyway). Every running network
      connection requires one file handle, and the rest are available
      for queues to use. If there are more disk-accessing queues than
      file handles after network connections have been taken into
      account, then the disk-accessing queues will share the file
      handles among themselves; each gets to use a file handle for a
      while before it is taken back and given to another queue.
    </p>

    <p>
      This prevents the server from crashing due to there being too
      many disk-accessing queues, but it can become expensive. The
      management plugin can show I/O statistics for each node in the
      cluster; as well as showing rates of reads, writes, seeks and so
      on it will also show a rate of <i>reopen</i>s - the rate at
      which file handles are recycled in this way. A busy server with
      too few file handles might be doing hundreds of reopens per
      second - in which case its performance is likely to increase
      notably if given more file handles.
    </p>

    <h3 id="async-threads">Too few async threads</h3>

    <p>
      The Erlang virtual machine creates a pool of <i>async
      threads</i> to handle long-running file I/O operations. These
      are shared among all queues. Every active file I/O operation
      uses one async thread while it is occurring. Having too few
      async threads can therefore hurt performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the situation with async threads is not exactly
      analogous to the situation with file handles. If a queue
      executes a number of I/O operations in sequence it will perform
      best if it holds onto a file handle for all the operations;
      otherwise we may flush and seek too much and use additional CPU
      orchestrating it. However, queues do not benefit from holding an
      async thread across a sequence of operations (in fact they
      cannot do so).
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore there should ideally be enough file handles for all
      the queues that are executing streams of I/O operations, and
      enough async threads for the number of simultaneous I/O
      operations your storage layer can plausibly execute.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's less obvious when a lack of async threads is causing
      performance problems. (It's also less likely in general; check
      for other things first!) Typical symptoms of too few async
      threads include the number of I/O operations per second dropping
      to zero (as reported by the management plugin) for brief periods
      when the server should be busy with persistence, while the
      reported time per I/O operation increases.
    </p>

    <p>
      The number of async threads is configured by the <code>+A</code>
      argument to the Erlang virtual machine as described <a
      href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html#async_thread_pool_size">here</a>,
      and is typically configured through the envirnment variable
      <code>RABBITMQ_SERVER_ERL_ARGS</code>. The default value is
      <code>+A 64</code>. It is likely to be a good idea to experiment
      with several different values before changing this.
    </p>

    <h2 id="alternate-index">Alternate message store index implementations</h2>

    <p>
      As mentioned above, each message which is written to the message
      store uses a small amount of memory for its index entry. The
      message store index is pluggable in RabbitMQ, and other
      implementations are available as plugins which can remove this
      limitation. (The reason we do not ship any with the server is
      that they all use native code.) Note that such plugins typically
      make the message store run more slowly.

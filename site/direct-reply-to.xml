    <p class="intro">
      Improve performance and simplicity of RPC clients by sending
      replies direct to a waiting channel.
    </p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      RPC is a popular pattern to implement with a messaging broker
      like RabbitMQ. The typical way to do this is for RPC clients to
      send requests to a long lived server queue. The RPC server(s)
      read requests from this queue and then send replies to each client
      using the queue named by the client in the <code>reply-to</code>
      header.
    </p>

    <p>
      But where does the client's queue come from? The client can
      declare a single-use queue for each request-response pair. But
      this is inefficient; even a transient unmirrored queue can be
      expensive to create and then delete (compared with the cost of
      sending a message). This is especially true in a cluster as all
      cluster nodes need to agree that the queue has been created,
      even if it is unmirrored.
    </p>

    <p>
      So alternatively the client can create a long-lived queue for
      its replies. But this can be fiddly to manage, especially if the
      client itself is not long-lived.
    </p>

    <p>
      The direct reply-to feature allows RPC clients to receive
      replies directly from their RPC server, without going through a
      reply queue. ("Directly" here still means going through AMQP and
      the RabbitMQ server; there is no separate network connection
      between RPC client and RPC server.)
    </p>

    <h2>Use</h2>
    <p>
      To use direct reply-to, an RPC client should:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consume from the pseudo-queue
        <code>amq.rabbitmq.reply-to</code> in no-ack mode. There is no
        need to declare this "queue" first, although the client can do
        so if it wants.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the <code>reply-to</code> property in their request message to
        <code>amq.rabbitmq.reply-to</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The RPC server will then see a <code>reply-to</code> property
      with a generated name. It should publish to the default exchange
      ("") with the routing key set to this value (i.e. just as if
      it were sending to a reply queue as usual). The message will
      then be sent straight to the client consumer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the RPC server is going to perform some expensive computation
      it might wish to check if the client has gone away. To do this
      the server can declare the generated reply name first on a
      disposable channel in order to determine whether it still
      exists. Note that even if you declare the "queue" with
      <code>passive=false</code> there is no way to create it; the
      declare will just succeed (with 0 messages ready and 1 consumer)
      or fail.
    </p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The RPC client must consume in no-ack mode. This is because
        there is no queue for the reply message to be returned to if the
        client disconnects or rejects the reply message.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reply messages sent using this mechanism are in general not
        fault-tolerant; they will be discarded if the client that
        published the original request subsequently disconnects. The
        assumption is that an RPC client will reconnect and submit
        another request in this case.
      </li>
      <li>
        The name <code>amq.rabbitmq.reply-to</code> is used in
        <code>basic.consume</code> and the <code>reply-to</code>
        property as if it were a queue; however it is not. It cannot
        be deleted, and does not appear in the management plugin or
        <code>rabbitmqctl list_queues</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the RPC server publishes with the mandatory flag set then
        <code>amq.rabbitmq.reply-to.*</code> is treated as <b>not</b>
        a queue; i.e. if the server only publishes to this name then
        the message will be considered "not routed"; a
        <code>basic.return</code> will be sent if the mandatory flag
        was set.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <doc:heading>Introduction</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Systems that use a messaging broker such as RabbitMQ are by
        definition distributed. Since protocol methods (messages) sent
        are not guaranteed to reach the peer or be successfully processed
        by it, both publishers and consumers need a mechanism for
        delivery and processing confirmation. Several messaging
        protocols supported by RabbitMQ provide such features.
        This guide covers the features in AMQP 0-9-1 but the idea
        is largely the same in other protocols (STOMP, MQTT, et cetera).
      </p>
      <p>
        Delivery processing acknowledgements from consumers to RabbitMQ
        are known as acknowledgements in AMQP 0-9-1 parlance; broker
        acknowledgements to publishers are a protocol extension called
        publisher confirms.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="consumer-acknowledgements">
      <doc:heading>(Consumer) Delivery Acknowledgements</doc:heading>

      <p>
        When RabbitMQ delivers a message to a consumer, it needs to know
        when to consider the message successfully sent. What kind of logic is
        optimal depends on the system. It is therefore primarily an application
        decision. In AMQP 0-9-1 it is made when a consumer is registered using
        the <code>basic.consume</code> method or a message is fetched on demand
        with the <code>basic.get</code> method.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you prefer a more example-oriented and step-by-step material, consumer acknowledgements are
        also covered in <a href="/getstarted.html">RabbitMQ tutorial #2</a>.
      </p>

      <doc:subsection name="consumer-acks-delivery-tags">
        <doc:heading>Delivery Identifiers: Delivery Tags</doc:heading>

        <p>
          Before we proceed to discuss other topics it is important to
          explain how deliveries are identified (and acknowledgements
          indicate their respective deliveries).  When a consumer
          (subscription) is registered, messages will be delivered
          (pushed) by RabbitMQ using the <code>basic.deliver</code>
          method.  The method carries a <em>delivery tag</em>, which
          uniquely identifies the delivery on a channel. Delivery tags are
          therefore scoped per channel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delivery tags are monotonically growing positive
          integers and are presented as such by client libraries.
          Client library methods that acknowledge deliveries take a delivery tag
          as an argument.
        </p>
      </doc:subsection>

      <doc:subsection name="acknowledgement-modes">
        <doc:heading>Acknowledgement Modes</doc:heading>

        <p>
          Depending on the acknowledgement mode used, RabbitMQ can consider a message to be
          successfully delivered either immediately after it is sent out (written to a TCP socket)
          or when an explicit ("manual") client acknowledgement is received. Manually sent
          acknowledgements can be positive or negative and use one of the following protocol methods:

          <ul>
            <li><code>basic.ack</code> is used for positive acknowledgements</li>
            <li><code>basic.nack</code> is used for negative acknowledgements (note: this is a <a href="/nack.html">RabbitMQ extension to AMQP 0-9-1</a>)</li>
            <li><code>basic.reject</code> is used for negative acknowledgements but has one limitation compared to <code>basic.nack</code></li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Positive acknowledgements simply instruct RabbitMQ to record a message as delivered.
          Negative acknowledgements with <code>basic.reject</code> have the same effect. The difference
          is primarily in the semantics: positive acknowledgements assume
          a message was successfully processed while their negative counterpart
          suggests that a delivery wasn't processed but still should be deleted.
        </p>

        <p>
          In automatic acknowledgement mode, a message is considered
          to be successfully delivered immediately after it is
          sent. This mode trades off higher throughput (as long as the
          consumers can keep up) for reduced safety of delivery and
          consumer processing. This mode is often referred to as
          "fire-and-forget".  Unlike with manual acknowledgement
          model, if consumers's TCP connection or channel is closed
          before successful delivery, it will be lost.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another things that's important to consider when using
          automatic acknowledgement mode is that of consumer overload.
          Manual acknowledgement mode is typically used with a bounded
          channel prefetch which limits the number of outstanding ("in progress")
          deliveries on a channel. With automatic acknowledgements, however, there is
          no such limit by definition. Consumers therefore can be overwhelmed by
          the rate of deliveries, potentially accumulating a backlog in memory
          and running out of heap or getting their process terminated by the OS.
          Some client libraries will apply TCP back pressure (stop reading from the socket
          until the backlog of unprocessed deliveries drops beyond a certain limit).
          Automatic acknolwedgement mode is therefore only recommended for consumers
          that can process deliveries efficiently and at a steady rate.
        </p>
      </doc:subsection>

      <doc:subsection name="consumer-acks-multiple-parameter">
        <doc:heading>Acknowledging Multiple Deliveries at Once</doc:heading>

        <p>
          Manual acknowledgements can be batched to reduce network traffic.
          This is done by setting the <code>multiple</code> field of acknowledgement
          methods (see above) to <code>true</code>. Note that <code>basic.reject</code> doesn't
          historically have the field and that's why <code>basic.nack</code> was introduced
          by RabbitMQ as a protocol extension.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the <code>multiple</code> field is set to <code>true</code>, RabbitMQ will acknowledge
          all outstanding delivery tags up to and including the tag specified in the
          acknowledgement. Like everything else related to acknowledgements, this is scoped per channel.
          For example, given that there are delivery tags 5, 6, 7, and 8 unacknowledged on channel <code>Ch</code>,
          when an acknowledgement frame arrives on that channel with <code>delivery_tag</code> set to <code>8</code>
          and <code>multiple</code> set to <code>true</code>, all tags from 5 to 8 will be acknowledged.
          If <code>multiple</code> was set to <code>false</code>, deliveries 5, 6, and 7 would still
          be unacknowledged.
        </p>
      </doc:subsection>

      <doc:subsection name="channel-qos-prefetch">
        <doc:heading>Channel Prefetch Setting (QoS)</doc:heading>

        <p>
          Because messages are sent (pushed) to clients
          asynchronously, there is usually more than one message "in
          flight" on a channel at any given moment. In addition,
          manual acknowledgements from clients are also inherently
          asynchronous in nature. So there's a sliding window of
          delivery tags that are unacknowledged. Developers would
          often prefer to cap the size of this window to avoid the
          unbounded buffer problem on the consumer end. This is done
          by setting a "prefetch count" value using the
          <code>basic.qos</code> method. The value defines the max
          number of unacknowledged deliveries that are permitted on a
          channel. Once the number reaches the configured count,
          RabbitMQ will stop delivering more messages on the channel
          unless at least one of the outstanding ones is acknowledged.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, given that there are delivery tags 5, 6, 7, and
          8 unacknowledged on channel <code>Ch</code> and channel
          <code>Ch</code>'s prefetch count is set to 4, RabbitMQ will
          not push any more deliveries on <code>Ch</code> unless at
          least one of the outstanding deliveries is acknowledged.
          When an acknowledgement frame arrives on that channel with
          <code>delivery_tag</code> set to <code>8</code>, RabbitMQ
          will notice and deliver one more message.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's worth reiterating that the flow of deliveries and
          manual client acknowledgements is entirely
          asynchronous. Therefore if prefetch value is changed while
          there already are deliveries in flight, a natural race
          condition arises and there can temporarily be more than
          prefetch count unacknowledged messages on a channel.
        </p>

        <p>
          The QoS setting can be configured for a channel or a consumer.
          See <a href="/consumer-prefetch.html">Consumer Prefetch</a> for details.
        </p>

        <p>
          Manual acknowledgement mode with unlimited QoS should be used with care.
          Consumers that consume a lot of messages without acknowledging will lead
          to memory consumption growth on the node they are connected to. Finding
          a suitable QoS value is a matter of trial and error and will vary from
          workload to workload. Values in the 100 through 300 range usually offer
          optimal throughput and do not run significant risk of overwhelming consumers.
          Higher values often <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2014/04/14/finding-bottlenecks-with-rabbitmq-3-3/">run into the law of diminishing returns</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The QoS setting has no effect on messages fetched using the <code>basic.get</code>
          ("pull API"), even in manual confirmation mode.

      <doc:subsection name="automatic-requeueing">
        <doc:heading>When Consumers Fail or Lose Connection: Automatic Requeueing</doc:heading>
        <p>
          When manual acknowledgements are used, any delivery
          (message) that was not acked is automatically requeued when
          the channel (or connection) on which the delivery happened
          is closed. This includes TCP connection loss by clients,
          consumer application (process) failures, and channel-level
          protocol exceptions (covered below).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that it takes a period of time to <a href="/heartbeats.html">detect an unavailable client</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to this behavior, consumers must be prepared to handle redeliveries and otherwise
          be implemented with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">idempotence</a> in mind.
          Redeliveries will have a special boolean property, <code>redeliver</code>, set to <code>true</code>
          by RabbitMQ. For first time deliveries it will be set to <code>false</code>. Note that
          a consumer can receive a message that was previously delivered to another consumer.
        </p>

        <doc:heading>Client Errors: Double Acking and Unknown Tags</doc:heading>
        <p>
          Should a client acknowledge the same delivery tag more than once,
          RabbitMQ will result a channel error such as <code>PRECONDITION_FAILED - unknown delivery tag 100</code>.
          The same channel exception will be thrown if an unknown delivery tag is used.

    <doc:section name="publisher-confirms">
      <doc:heading>Publisher Confirms</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Using standard AMQP 0-9-1, the only way to guarantee that a
        message isn't lost is by using transactions -- make the
        channel transactional, publish the message, commit.  In this
        case, transactions are unnecessarily heavyweight and
        decrease throughput by a factor of 250.  To remedy this,
        a confirmation mechanism was introduced. It mimics the consumer
        acknowledgements mechanism already present in the protocol.
      </p>

      <p>
        To enable confirms, a client sends the
        <code>confirm.select</code> method.  Depending on whether
        <code>no-wait</code> was set or not, the broker may respond
        with a <code>confirm.select-ok</code>.  Once the
        <code>confirm.select</code> method is used on a channel, it
        is said to be in confirm mode.  A transactional channel
        cannot be put into confirm mode and once a channel is in
        confirm mode, it cannot be made transactional.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a channel is in confirm mode, both the broker and the
        client count messages (counting starts at 1 on the first
        <code>confirm.select</code>).  The broker then confirms
        messages as it handles them by sending a
        <code>basic.ack</code> on the same channel. The
        <code>delivery-tag</code> field contains the sequence number
        of the confirmed message.  The broker may also set the
        <code>multiple</code> field in <code>basic.ack</code> to
        indicate that all messages up to and including the one with
        the sequence number have been handled.
      </p>

      <p>
        An example in Java that publishes a large number of
        messages to a channel in confirm mode and waits for the
        acknowledgements can be found <a
        href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test/master/src/main/java/com/rabbitmq/examples/ConfirmDontLoseMessages.java">here</a>.
      </p>

      <doc:subsection name="server-sent-nacks">
        <doc:heading>Negative Acknowledgment</doc:heading>

        <p>
          In exceptional cases when the broker is unable to handle
          messages successfully, instead of a <code>basic.ack</code>,
          the broker will send a <code>basic.nack</code>.  In this
          context, fields of the <code>basic.nack</code> have the same
          meaning as the corresponding ones in <code>basic.ack</code>
          and the <code>requeue</code> field should be ignored.  By
          nack'ing one or more messages, the broker indicates that it
          was unable to process the messages and refuses responsibility
          for them; at that point, the client may choose to re-publish
          the messages.
        </p>

        <p>
          After a channel is put into confirm mode, all subsequently
          published messages will be confirmed or nack'd once.  No
          guarantees are made as to how soon a message is confirmed.
          No message will be both confirmed and nack'd.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>basic.nack</code> will only be delivered if an internal
          error occurs in the Erlang process responsible for a queue.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a message is requeued, it will be placed to its original
          position in its queue, if possible. If not (due to concurrent
          deliveries and acknowledgements from other consumers when
          multiple consumers share a queue), the message will be requeued
          to a position closer to queue head.
        </p>
        </doc:subsection>

      <doc:subsection name="when-publishes-are-confirmed">
        <doc:heading>When will messages be confirmed?</doc:heading>

        <p>
          For unroutable messages, the broker will issue a confirm
          once the exchange verifies a message won't route to any queue
          (returns an empty list of queues). If the message is also
          published as mandatory, the <code>basic.return</code> is sent
          to the client before <code>basic.ack</code>. The same
          is true for negative acknowledgements (<code>basic.nack</code>).
        </p>

        <p>
          For routable messages, the <code>basic.ack</code> is sent when a
          message has been accepted by all the queues. For persistent
          messages routed to durable queues, this <strong>means persisting
          to disk</strong>. For mirrored queues, this means that all
          mirrors have accepted the message.

      <doc:subsection name="publisher-confirms-latency">
        <doc:heading>Ack Latency for Persistent Messages</doc:heading>

        <p>
          <code>basic.ack</code> for a persistent message routed to a
          durable queue will be sent after persisting the message to
          disk. The RabbitMQ message store persists messages to disk in
          batches after an interval (a few hundred milliseconds) to
          minimise the number of fsync(2) calls, or when a queue is idle.

          This means that under a constant load, latency for
          <code>basic.ack</code> can reach a few hundred milliseconds. To
          improve throughput, applications are strongly advised to
          process acknowledgements asynchronously (as a stream) or publish
          batches of messages and wait for outstanding confirms. The exact
          API for this varies between client libraries.

      </doc:subsection>

      <doc:subsection name="publisher-confirms-ordering">
        <doc:heading>Ordering Considerations for Publisher Confirms</doc:heading>

        <p>
          In most cases, RabbitMQ will acknowledge messages to
          publishers in the same order they were published (this
          applies for messages published on a single
          channel). However, publisher acknowledgements are emitted
          asynchronously and can confirm a single message or a group
          of messages. The exact moment when a confirm is emitted
          depends on the delivery mode of a message (persistent
          vs. transient) and the properties of the queue(s) the
          message was routed to (see above). Which is to say that
          different messages can be considered ready for
          acknowledgement at different times. This means that
          acknowledgements can arrive in a different order compared to
          their respective messages. Applications should not depend on
          the order of acknowledgements when possible.

      <doc:subsection name="publisher-confirms-and-guaranteed-delivery">
        <doc:heading>Publisher Confirms and Guaranteed Delivery</doc:heading>

        <p>
          The broker loses persistent messages if it crashes before
          said messages are written to disk.  Under certain
          conditions, this causes the broker to behave in surprising
          ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          For instance, consider this scenario:
          <ol>
            <li>a client publishes a persistent message to a durable
              queue</li>
            <li>a client consumes the message from the queue (noting
              that the message is persistent and the queue
              durable), but doesn't yet ack it,</li>
            <li>the broker dies and is restarted, and</li>
            <li>the client reconnects and starts consuming messages.</li>
          </ol>
          At this point, the client could reasonably assume that the
          message will be delivered again.  This is not the case: the
          restart has caused the broker to lose the message.  In order to
          guarantee persistence, a client should use confirms.  If the
          publisher's channel had been in confirm mode, the publisher
          would <em>not</em> have received an ack for the lost message
          (since the message hadn't been written to disk yet).

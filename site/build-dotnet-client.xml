	This section describes the process for obtaining a copy of the
	RabbitMQ .Net/C# RabbitMQ client library source code, as well as
	instructions for building the .Net/C# client libraries from source.

	    Either download a released source code distribution from

git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client.git

        Microsoft Visual Studio® 2015 or later (optional, Community edition is fine)

        To build the source with Visual Studio you need to:
      </p>
      <ul class="compact">
        <li>
          Run <code>build.bat</code>. This will perform the required
          code generation as well as building a release version of the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Open <code>RabbitMQDotNetClient.sln</code> in Visual
          Studio. That may fail if the version of Visual Studio used
          is different from the one that created the solution file. In
          most such cases this can be corrected by opening the
          solution file in a text editor and adjusting the Format
          Version number at the beginning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Build the solution.

        The library can be built on Linux with Mono, but only with
        Mono version 3.8 and later. You can
        obtain the latest versions of Mono at <a
        href="http://mono-project.com/">mono-project.com</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you have installed a suitable version of Mono, and <a
        href="#obtaining">obtained the RabbitMQ .Net/C# RabbitMQ client
        library source code</a>, to build the library you should:

      <ul class="compact">
        <li>
          Run <code>build.sh</code>. This will perform the required

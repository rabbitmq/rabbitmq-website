    <title>Authentication Failure Notifications</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      AMQP requires brokers to terminate the network connection if an authentication
      failure occurs during connection establishment. This makes it difficult for
      clients to distinguish such authentication failures from genuine network
      interruptions during the early stages of connection establishment.
      The RabbitMQ broker offers explicit authentication failure notifications
      for clients that advertise their capacity to receive such notifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broker will report failures differently depending on the presence of the
      <code>authentication_failure_close</code> <a href="consumer-cancel.html#capabilities">capability</a>.
      If this capability is absent then authentication failures are reported
      in the legacy fashion: by abruptly closing the network connection. If this
      capability is present then the broker will send a <code>basic.close</code>
      command to the client indicating ACCESS_REFUSED as the reason. The broker
      will create a log entry for the authentication failure in either case.

    <title>What can RabbitMQ do for you?</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <p class="intro">
        Messaging enables software applications to connect and scale.
        Applications can connect to each other, as components of a
        larger application, or to user devices and data.  Messaging is
        asynchronous, decoupling applications by separating sending
        and receiving data.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be thinking of data delivery, non-blocking operations
        or push notifications. Or you want to use publish / subscribe,
        asynchronous processing, or work queues. All these are
        patterns, and they form part of messaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        RabbitMQ is a messaging broker - an intermediary for
        messaging. It gives your applications a common platform to
        send and receive messages, and your messages a safe place to
        live until received.
      </p>

        <h2>Feature Highlights</h2>

        <h3>Reliability</h3>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ offers a variety of features to let you trade off
          performance with reliability, including persistence,
          delivery acknowledgements, publisher confirms, and high
          availability.
        </p>

        <h3>Flexible Routing</h3>
        <p>
          Messages are routed through exchanges before arriving at
          queues. RabbitMQ features several built-in exchange types
          for typical routing logic. For more complex routing you
          can <a href="extensions.html#routing">bind exchanges
          together</a> or even write your own exchange type as a
          plugin.
        </p>

        <h3>Clustering</h3>
        <p>
          Several RabbitMQ servers on a local network can
          be <a href="clustering.html">clustered</a> together, forming
          a single logical broker.
        </p>

        <h3>Federation</h3>
        <p>
          For servers that need to be more loosely and unreliably
          connected than clustering allows, RabbitMQ offers a
          federation model.
        </p>

        <h3>Highly Available Queues</h3>
        <p>
          Queues can be <a href="ha.html">mirrored</a> across several
          machines in a cluster, ensuring that even in the event of
          hardware failure your messages are safe.
        </p>

        <h3>Multi-protocol</h3>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ supports messaging over <a href="protocols.html">a
          variety of messaging protocols</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Many Clients</h3>
        <p>
          There are RabbitMQ clients for almost
          any <a href="devtools.html">language</a> you can think of.
        </p>

        <h3>Management UI</h3>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ ships with an easy-to
          use <a href="management.html">management UI</a> that allows
          you to monitor and control every aspect of your message
          broker.
        </p>

        <h3>Tracing</h3>
        <p>
          If your messaging system is misbehaving, RabbitMQ
          offers <a href="firehose.html">tracing</a> support to let
          you find out what's going on.
        </p>

        <h3>Plugin System</h3>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ ships with a variety
          of <a href="plugins.html">plugins</a> extending it in
          different ways, and you can
          also <a href="plugin-development.html">write your own</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>And Also...</h2>

        <h3>Commercial Support</h3>
        <p>
          Commercial <a href="services.html">support, training and
          consulting</a> are available from Pivotal.
        </p>

        <h3>Large Community</h3>
        <p>
          There's a large <a href="devtools.html">community</a> around
          RabbitMQ, producing all sorts of clients, plugins, guides,
          etc. Join

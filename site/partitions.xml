    <title>Clustering and Network Partitions</title>
  </head>
  <body show-in-this-page="true">
    <p>
      RabbitMQ clusters do not tolerate network partitions well. If
      you are thinking of clustering across a WAN, don't. You should
      use <a href="federation.html">federation</a> or
      the <a href="shovel.html">shovel</a> instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, sometimes accidents happen. This page documents how
      to detect network partitions, some of the bad effects that may
      happen during partitions, and how to recover from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ stores information about queues, exchanges, bindings
      etc in Erlang's distributed database, <i>Mnesia</i>. Many of
      the details of what happens around network partitions are
      related to Mnesia's behaviour.
    </p>

    <doc:section name="detecting">
    <doc:heading>Detecting network partitions</doc:heading>
    <p>
      Mnesia will typically determine that a node is down if another
      node is unable to contact it for a minute or so (see the page
      on <a href="nettick.html">net_ticktime</a>). If two nodes come back into
      contact, both having thought the other is down, Mnesia will
      determine that a partition has occured. This will be written to
      the RabbitMQ log in a form like:
    </p>
    <pre>=ERROR REPORT==== 15-Oct-2012::18:02:30 ===
Mnesia(rabbit@smacmullen): ** ERROR ** mnesia_event got
    {inconsistent_database, running_partitioned_network, hare@smacmullen}</pre>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ nodes will record whether this event has ever occured
      while the node is up, and expose this information
      through <code>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</code> and the
      management plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</code> will normally show an
      empty list for <code>partitions</code>:
    </p>
    <pre># rabbitmqctl cluster_status
Cluster status of node rabbit@smacmullen ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[hare@smacmullen,rabbit@smacmullen]}]},
 {running_nodes,[rabbit@smacmullen,hare@smacmullen]},
 {partitions,[]}]
...done.</pre>
    <p>
      However, if a network partition has occured then information
      about partitions will appear there:
    </p>
    <pre># rabbitmqctl cluster_status
Cluster status of node rabbit@smacmullen ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[hare@smacmullen,rabbit@smacmullen]}]},
 {running_nodes,[rabbit@smacmullen,hare@smacmullen]},
 {partitions,[{rabbit@smacmullen,[hare@smacmullen]},
              {hare@smacmullen,[rabbit@smacmullen]}]}]
...done.</pre>
    <p>
      The management plugin API will return partition
      information for each node under <code>partitions</code>
      in <code>/api/nodes</code>. The management plugin UI will show a
      large red warning on the overview page if a partition has
      occured.

    <doc:section name="during">
    <doc:heading>During a network partition</doc:heading>
    <p>
      While a network partition is in place, the two (or more!) sides
      of the cluster can evolve independently, with both sides
      thinking the other has crashed. Queues, bindings, exchanges can
      be created or deleted separately. <a href="ha.html">Mirrored
      queues</a> which are split across the partition will end up with
      one master on each side of the partition, again with both sides
      acting independently. Other undefined and weird behaviour may
      occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>It is important to understand that when network connectivity
      is restored, this state of affairs persists. The cluster
      will continue to act in this way until you take action to
      fix it.</b>

    <doc:section name="suspend">
    <doc:heading>Partitions caused by suspend / resume</doc:heading>
    <p>
      While we refer to "network" partitions, really a partition is
      any case in which the different nodes of a cluster can have
      communication interrupted without any node failing. In addition
      to network failures, suspending and resuming an entire OS can
      also cause partitions when used against running cluster nodes -
      as the suspended node will not consider itself to have failed, or
      even stopped, but the other nodes in the cluster will consider
      it to have done so.
    </p>

    <p>
      While you could suspend a cluster node by running it on a laptop
      and closing the lid, the most common reason for this to happen
      is for a virtual machine to have been suspended by the
      hypervisor. While it's fine to run RabbitMQ clusters in
      virtualised environments, you should make sure that VMs are not
      suspended while running. Note that some virtualisation features
      such as migration of a VM from one host to another will tend to
      involve the VM being suspended.
    </p>

    <p>
      Partitions caused by suspend and resume will tend to be
      asymmetrical - the suspended node will not necessarily see the
      other nodes as having gone down, but will be seen as down by the
      rest of the cluster. This has particular implications for <a
      href="#pause-minority">pause_minority</a> mode.
    </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="recovering">
    <doc:heading>Recovering from a network partition</doc:heading>
    <p>
      To recover from a network partition, first choose one partition
      which you trust the most. This partition will become the
      authority for the state of Mnesia to use; any changes which have
      occured on other partitions will be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stop all nodes in the other partitions, then start them all up
      again. When they rejoin the cluster they will restore state from
      the trusted partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, you should also restart all the nodes in the trusted
      partition to clear the warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be simpler to stop the whole cluster and start it again;
      if so make sure that the <b>first</b> node you start is from the
      trusted partition.
    </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="automatic-handling">
    <doc:heading>Automatically handling partitions</doc:heading>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ also offers three ways to deal with network partitions
      automatically: <i>pause-minority</i> mode, <i>pause-if-all-down</i>
      mode and <i>autoheal</i> mode. (The default behaviour is referred
      to as <i>ignore</i> mode).
    </p>

    <p>
      In pause-minority mode RabbitMQ will automatically pause cluster
      nodes which determine themselves to be in a minority (i.e. fewer
      or equal than half the total number of nodes) after seeing other
      nodes go down. It therefore chooses partition tolerance over
      availability from the CAP theorem. This ensures that in the
      event of a network partition, at most the nodes in a single
      partition will continue to run. The minority nodes will pause as
      soon as a partition starts, and will start again when the
      partition ends.
    </p>

    <p>
      In pause-if-all-down mode, RabbitMQ will automatically pause
      cluster nodes which cannot reach any of the listed nodes. In
      other words, all the listed nodes must be down for RabbitMQ
      to pause a cluster node. This is close to the pause-minority
      mode, however, it allows an administrator to decide which nodes
      to prefer, instead of relying on the context. For instance,
      if the cluster is made of two nodes in datacenter A and two
      nodes in datacenter B, and the link between datacenters is lost,
      pause-minority mode will pause all nodes. In pause-if-all-down
      mode, if the administrator listed the two nodes in datacenter A,
      only nodes in datacenter B will pause. Note that it is possible
      the listed nodes get split across both sides of a partition:
      in this situation, no node will pause. That is why there is an
      additional <i>ignore</i>/<i>autoheal</i> argument to indicate how
      to recover from the partition.
    </p>

    <p>
      In autoheal mode RabbitMQ will automatically decide on a winning
      partition if a partition is deemed to have occurred, and will
      restart all nodes that are not in the winning partition. Unlike
      pause_minority mode it therefore takes effect when a partition
      ends, rather than when one starts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winning partition is the one which has the most clients
      connected (or if this produces a draw, the one with the most
      nodes; and if that still produces a draw then one of the
      partitions is chosen in an unspecified way).
    </p>

    <p>
      You can enable either mode by setting the configuration
      parameter <code>cluster_partition_handling</code> for
      the <code>rabbit</code> application in
      your <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">configuration
      file</a> to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>pause_minority</code></li>
      <li><code>{pause_if_all_down, [nodes], ignore | autoheal}</code></li>
      <li><code>autoheal</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="which-mode">Which mode should I pick?</h3>

    <p>
      It's important to understand that allowing RabbitMQ to deal with
      network partitions automatically does not make them less of a
      problem. Network partitions will always cause problems for
      RabbitMQ clusters; you just get some degree of choice over what
      kind of problems you get. As stated in the introduction, if you
      want to connect RabbitMQ clusters over generally unreliable
      links, you should use federation or the shovel.
    </p>

    <p>
      With that said, you might wish to pick a recovery mode as
      follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>ignore</code> - Your network really is reliable. All
        your nodes are in a rack, connected with a switch, and that
        switch is also the route to the outside world. You don't want
        to run any risk of any of your cluster shutting down if any
        other part of it fails (or you have a two node cluster).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>pause_minority</code> - Your network is maybe less
        reliable. You have clustered across 3 AZs in EC2, and you
        assume that only one AZ will fail at once. In that scenario
        you want the remaining two AZs to continue working and the
        nodes from the failed AZ to rejoin automatically and without
        fuss when the AZ comes back.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>autoheal</code> - Your network may not be reliable. You
        are more concerned with continuity of service than with data
        integrity. You may have a two node cluster.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="pause-minority">More about pause-minority mode</h3>
    <p>
      The Erlang VM on the paused nodes will continue running but the
      nodes will not listen on any ports or do any other work. They
      will check once per second to see if the rest of the cluster has
      reappeared, and start up again if it has.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that nodes will not enter the paused state at startup, even
      if they are in a minority then. It is expected that any such
      minority at startup is due to the rest of the cluster not having
      been started yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also note that RabbitMQ will pause nodes which are not in a
      <i>strict</i> majority of the cluster - i.e. containing more
      than half of all nodes. It is therefore not a good idea to
      enable pause-minority mode on a cluster of two nodes since in
      the event of any network partition <b>or node failure</b>, both
      nodes will pause. However, <code>pause_minority</code> mode is
      likely to be safer than <code>ignore</code> mode for clusters of
      more than two nodes, especially if the most likely form of
      network partition is that a single minority of nodes drops off
      the network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, note that <code>pause_minority</code> mode will do
      nothing to defend against partitions caused by cluster nodes
      being <a href="#suspend">suspended</a>. This is because
      the suspended node will never see the rest of the cluster
      vanish, so will have no trigger to disconnect itself from the
      cluster.

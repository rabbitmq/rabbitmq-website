    <title>Alternate Exchanges</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      It is sometimes desirable to let clients handle messages
      that an exchange was unable to route (i.e. either because
      there were no bound queues our no matching
      bindings). Typical examples of this are
      <ul>
        <li>detecting when clients accidentally or maliciously
          publish messages that cannot be routed</li>
        <li>"or else" routing semantics where some messages are
          handled specially and the rest by a generic handler</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ's <em>Alternate Exchange</em> ("AE") feature
      addresses these use cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      For any given exchange, an AE can be defined by clients using
      the exchange's arguments, or in the server
      using <a href="parameters.html#policies">policies</a>. In the
      case where both policy and arguments specify an AE, the one
      specified in arguments overrules the one specified in policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Configuration using arguments</h2>
    <p>
      When creating an exchange the name of an AE can be
      optionally supplied in the <code>exchange.declare</code>
      method's <code>arguments</code> table by specifying a key
      of 'alternate-exchange' and a value of type 'S' (string)
      containing the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an AE has been specified, in addition to the usual
      <em>configure</em> permissions on the declared exchange,
      the user needs to have <em>read</em> permissions on that
      exchange and <em>write</em> permissions on the AE.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
    </p>
    <pre class="sourcecode java">
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; args = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
args.put("alternate-exchange", "my-ae");
channel.exchangeDeclare("my-direct", "direct", false, false, args);
channel.exchangeDeclare("my-ae", "fanout");
channel.queueDeclare("routed");
channel.queueBind("routed", "my-direct", "key1");
channel.queueDeclare("unrouted");
channel.queueBind("unrouted", "my-ae", "");</pre>
    <p>
      In the above fragment of Java code we create a direct
      exchange 'my-direct' that is configured with an AE called
      'my-ae'. The latter is declared as a fanout exchange. We
      bind one queue 'routed' to 'my-direct' with a binding key
      of 'key1', and a queue 'unrouted' to 'my-ae'.
    </p>

    <h2>Configuration using policy</h2>

    <p>
      To specify an AE using policy, add the key 'alternate-exchange'
      to a policy definition. For example:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>rabbitmqctl</th>
        <td>
          <pre>rabbitmqctl set_policy AE "^my-direct$" '{"alternate-exchange":"my-ae"}'</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>rabbitmqctl (Windows)</th>
        <td>
          <pre>rabbitmqctl set_policy AE "^my-direct$" "{""alternate-exchange"":""my-ae""}"</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      This will apply an AE of "my-ae" to the exchange called
       "my-direct". Policies can also be defined using the management
       plugin, see the <a href="parameters.html#policies">policy
       documentation</a> for more details.
    </p>

    <h2>Alternate exchange logic</h2>

    <p>
      Whenever an exchange with a configured AE cannot route a message
      to any queue, it publishes the message to the specified AE
      instead. If that AE does not exist then a warning is logged. If
      an AE cannot route a message, it in turn publishes the message
      to its AE, if it has one configured. This process continues
      until either the message is successfully routed, the end of the
      chain of AEs is reached, or an AE is encountered which has
      already attempted to route the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example if we publish a message to 'my-direct' with a
      routing key of 'key1' then that message is routed to the
      'routed' queue, in accordance with the standard AMQP
      behaviour.  However, when publishing a message to
      'my-direct' with a routing key of 'key2', rather than
      being discarded the message is routed via our configured
      AE to the 'unrouted' queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The behaviour of an AE purely pertains to routing. If a message
      is routed via an AE it still counts as routed for the purpose of
      the 'mandatory' flag, and the message is otherwise unchanged.

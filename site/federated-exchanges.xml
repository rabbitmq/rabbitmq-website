          <b>What does a federated exchange do?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            A federated exchange links to other exchanges (called
            <i>upstream</i> exchanges). Logically (see next item), messages
            published to the upstream exchanges are copied to the federated
            exchange, as though they were published directly to it. The upstream
            exchanges do not need to be reconfigured and they do not have to be
            on the same broker or in the same cluster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a diagram showing a single federated exchange in one
            broker linking to a set of two upstream exchanges in other
            brokers.
          </p>
          <img src="img/federation00.png" height="250" alt="Basic federated exchange" title="Basic federated exchange"/>
          <p>
            All of the configuration needed to establish the upstream
            links and the federated exchange is in the broker with the
            federated exchange.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <b>Are <i>all</i> messages copied?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Only those messages that need to be copied are propagated.
            This is an optimisation arranged dynamically by the federation
            plugin. (See <a href="#details">below</a>.)
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <b>How does a federated exchange link to its upstream exchanges?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The federated exchange will connect to all its upstream
            exchanges using AMQP. When declaring or configuring the
            federated exchange each upstream exchange is listed with
            the connection properties to be used to establish the
            link.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <b>Can I federate a federated exchange?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            There is nothing to prevent a federated exchange being 'upstream'
            from another federated exchange. One can even form 'loops', for
            example, exchange A declares exchange B to be upstream from it, and
            exchange B declares exchange A to be upstream from it. More complex
            multiply-connected arrangements are allowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            To prevent messages being continually copied and re-routed (in a
            never-ending cycle) there is a limit placed on the number of times a
            message can be copied over a link (see
            <a href="#upstream-sets"><code>max-hops</code></a> below). It is
            recommended that all the exchanges linked by federation are of the
            same type. Mixing types will lead to strange
            routing behaviour.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <b>Can I federate any exchange?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Nearly. You can't federate the default exchange (named ''), since
            that is really just a way to directly address queues. You also
            can't federate exchanges that are marked as internal (since
            exchanges federate messages that are published directly to them,
            and you can't publish directly to an internal exchange).
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <b>What are typical uses for federated exchanges?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            One typical use would be to have the same "logical" exchange
            distributed over many brokers. Each broker would declare a federated
            exchange with all the other federated exchanges upstream. (The links
            would form a complete bi-directional graph on <i>n</i> exchanges.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Another use would be to implement massive fanout - a single "root"
            exchange in one broker (which need not be federated) can be declared
            as upstream by many other federated exchanges in other brokers. In
            turn, each of these can be upstream for many more exchanges, and so
            on.
          </p>
          <p>
            See the <a href="#topology-diagrams">example diagrams
            below</a> for some possible arrangements.

        <doc:heading>Implementation</doc:heading>
          <p>
            Inter-broker communication is implemented using AMQP (optionally
            secured with SSL). Bindings are grouped together and bind / unbind
            commands are sent to the upstream exchange. Therefore the federated
            exchange only receives messages for which it has a subscription. The
            bindings are sent upstream asynchronously - so the effect of adding
            or removing a binding is only guaranteed to be seen eventually.
          </p>
          <p>
            The messages are buffered in a queue created in the upstream
            exchange's broker. This is called the <i>upstream queue</i>.
            It is the upstream queue which is bound to the upstream
            exchange with the grouped bindings. It is possible to tailor
            some of the properties of this queue in the <a
            href="federation-reference.html#upstreams">upstream
            configuration</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a detailed diagram showing a single federated
            exchange linking to a single upstream exchange including the
            upstream queue and bindings created by the federation plugin
            shown in grey. The fat arrow on the upstream link indicates
            messages republished by the federated exchange. Some
            potential publisher clients are shown publishing to both
            exchanges.
          </p>

          <p>
            Publications to either exchange may be received by queues bound to
            the federated exchange, but publications directly to the federated
            exchange cannot be received by queues bound to the upstream
            exchange.

    <doc:section name="topology-diagrams">
      <doc:heading>Example topologies</doc:heading>
      <p>
        We illustrate some example federation topologies. Where RabbitMQ
        brokers are shown in these diagrams (indicated by a <img
        src="img/rabbitmq_logo_30x30.png" height="15"/>) it is possible
        to have a cluster of brokers instead.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><b>Pair of federated exchanges</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Each exchange links to the other in this symmetric arrangement. A
            publisher and consumer connected to each broker are illustrated.
            Both consumers can receive messages published by either publisher.
          </p>
          <img src="img/federation02.png" height="215" alt="Symmetric pair" title="Symmetric pair" />
          <p>
            Both links are declared with <code>max-hops=1</code> so that
            messages are copied only once, otherwise the consumers will see
            multiple copies of the same message (up to the <code>max-hops</code>
            limit).
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Small complete graph</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            This arrangement is the analogue of the pair of federated exchanges
            but for three exchanges. Each exchange links to both the others.
          </p>
          <img src="img/federation03.png" height="250" alt="Three-way federation" title="Three-way federation" />
          <p>
            Again <code>max-hops=1</code> because the "hop distance" to any
            other exchange is exactly one. This will be the case in any complete
            graph of federated exchanges.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Fan-out</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            One master exchange (which it is <i>not</i> necessary to federate)
            is linked to by a tree of exchanges, which can extend to any depth.
            In this case messages published to the master exchange can be
            received by any consumer connected to any broker in the tree.
          </p>
          <img src="img/federation04.png" height="500" alt="Fan-out" title="Fan-out" />
          <p>
            Because there are no loops it is not as crucial to get the
            <code>max-hops</code> value right, but it must be at least
            as large as the longest connecting path. For a tree this is
            the number of levels minus one.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Ring</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            In this ring of six brokers each federated exchange links to just
            one other in the ring. The <code>"max-hops"</code> property is set
            to 5 so that every exchange in the ring sees the message exactly
            once.
          </p>
          <img src="img/federation05.png" height="300" alt="Ring" title="Ring" />
          <p>
            This topology, though relatively cheap in queues and connections, is
            rather fragile compared to a completely connected graph. One broker
            (or connection) failure breaks the ring.

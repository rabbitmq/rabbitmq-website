    <title>Blocked Connection Notifications</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      It is sometimes desirable for clients to receive a notification
      when their connection gets <a href="memory.html">blocked</a>
      due to the broker running low on resources (memory or disk).
    </p>

    <p>
      We have introduced an AMQP protocol extension in which the
      broker sends to the client a <code>connection.blocked</code>
      method when the connection gets blocked, and
      <code>connection.unblocked</code> when it is unblocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      To receive these notifications, the client must present a
      <code>capabilities</code> table in its
      <code>client-properties</code> in which there is a key
      <code>connection.blocked</code> and a boolean value
      <code>true</code>. See the <a
      href="#capabilities">capabilities</a> section for further
      details on this. Our supported clients indicate this capability
      by default and provide a way to register handlers for the
      <code>connection.blocked</code> and
      <code>connection.unblocked</code> methods.
    </p>

      <doc:heading>Using Blocked Connection Notifications with Java Client</doc:heading>

      <p>With the official Java client, blocked connection
      notifications are handled by <code>BlockedListener</code>
      interface implementations. They can be registered on a
      <code>Connection</code> using the
      <code>Connection.addBlockedListener</code> method:</p>

      <pre class="sourcecode java">
ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
connection.addBlockedListener(new BlockedListener() {
    public void handleBlocked(String reason) throws IOException {
        // Connection is now blocked
    }

    public void handleUnblocked() throws IOException {
        // Connection is now unblocked
    }
});
      </pre>
    </doc:section>

      <doc:heading>Using Blocked Connection Notifications with .NET Client</doc:heading>

      <p>With the official .NET client, blocked connection
      notifications are handled by the
      <code>RabbitMQ.Client.Events.ConnectionBlockedEventHandler</code>
      delegate. <code>IConnection</code> provides
      <code>IConnection.ConnectionBlocked</code> and
      <code>IConnection.ConnectionUnblocked</code> events:</p>

      <pre class="sourcecode java">
        public void HandleBlocked(IConnection sender, ConnectionBlockedEventArgs args)
        {
            // Connection is now blocked
        }

        public void HandleUnblocked(IConnection sender)
        {
            // Connection is now unblocked
        }

Conn.ConnectionBlocked   += HandleBlocked;
Conn.ConnectionUnblocked += HandleUnblocked;
      </pre>

    <doc:section>
      <doc:heading>When Notifications are Sent</doc:heading>
      <p>
        A <code>connection.blocked</code> notification is sent to
        publishing connections the first time RabbitMQ is low on a
        resource. For example, when a RabbitMQ node detects that it
        is low on RAM, it sends
        <code>connection.blocked</code> to all connected publishing
        clients supporting this feature. If before the connections
        are unblocked the node also starts running low on disk space,
        another <code>connection.blocked</code> will not be sent.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <code>connection.unblocked</code> is sent when <em>all</em>
        resource alarms have cleared and the connection is fully
        unblocked.

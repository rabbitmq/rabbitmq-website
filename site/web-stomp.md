# RabbitMQ Web STOMP Plugin NOSYNTAX

The Web STOMP plugin is a simple bridge exposing the
[STOMP](http://stomp.github.com) protocol over direct or emulated
[HTML5 WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets).

The main intention of Web-Stomp is to make it possible to use RabbitMQ
from Web browsers. It influenced the [Web MQTT plugin](/web-mqtt.html)
which is the same idea for a different protocol, [MQTT](/mqtt.html).

More context is available in
[the introductory blog post](http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2012/05/14/introducing-rabbitmq-web-stomp/).

## How It Works

RabbitMQ Web STOMP plugin is rather simple. It takes the STOMP protocol,
as provided by [RabbitMQ STOMP plugin](/stomp.html) and exposes it using
either plain WebSockets or [a SockJS server](http://sockjs.org) (WebSocket emulation).

SockJS is a WebSockets poly-fill that provides a WebSocket-like
JavaScript object in any browser. It will therefore work in older
browsers that don't have native WebSocket support, as well as in new
browsers that are behind WebSocket-unfriendly proxies.


## Enabling the Plugin

`rabbitmq_web_stomp` plugin ships with RabbitMQ.

To enable the plugin run [rabbitmq-plugins](/man/rabbitmq-plugins.1.man.html):

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_web_stomp
</pre>

## Usage

In order to use STOMP in a Web browser context, a JavaScript STOMP
library is required. We've tested a
[stomp-websocket](https://github.com/jmesnil/stomp-websocket/) library
by [Jeff Mesnil](https://github.com/jmesnil) and
[Jeff Lindsay](https://github.com/progrium).
[This library](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-stomp-examples/blob/master/priv/stomp.js)
is included as part of [RabbitMQ Web STOMP examples](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-stomp-examples).

By default the Web STOMP plugin exposes both a WebSocket and a
SockJS endpoint on port 15674. The WebSocket endpoint is available
on the `/ws` path:

<pre class="sourcecode">
http://127.0.0.1:15674/ws
</pre>

The SockJS endpoint on the `/stomp` prefix:

<pre class="sourcecode">
http://127.0.0.1:15674/stomp
</pre>

The SockJS endpoint is provided for compatibility purposes with
older browsers that do not implement Websocket. It has two
limitations because of SockJS:

 *  STOMP heart-beats are disabled
 *  Messages must be encoded using UTF-8

The raw Websocket endpoint was created to provide an alternative
that does not have these limitations. On the other hand, this
endpoint will only work with Websocket capable clients. Note that
some configuration is necessary in order to accept binary messages.

In order to establish connection from the browser using WebSocket
you may use code like:

<pre class="sourcecode html">
&lt;!-- include the client library --&gt;
&lt;script src=stomp.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<pre class="sourcecode javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
var ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:15674/ws');
var client = Stomp.over(ws);
[...]
</pre>

Using SockJS:

<pre class="sourcecode html">
&lt;!-- include SockJS --&gt;
&lt;script src="http://cdn.sockjs.org/sockjs-0.3.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- include the client library --&gt;    
&lt;script src="stomp.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<pre class="sourcecode javascript">
&lt;script&gt;

var ws = new SockJS('http://127.0.0.1:15674/stomp');
var client = Stomp.over(ws);
[...]
</pre>

Once you have the `client` object you can follow API's exposed by
stomp.js library. The next step is usually to establish a STOMP
connection with the broker:

<pre class="sourcecode javascript">
[...]
var on_connect = function() {
    console.log('connected');
};
var on_error =  function() {
    console.log('error');
};
client.connect('guest', 'guest', on_connect, on_error, '/');
[...]
</pre>

## Web STOMP Examples

A few simple Web STOMP examples are provided as a
[RabbitMQ Web STOMP examples](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-stomp-examples)
plugin. To get it running follow the installation instructions for that plugin
and enable the plugin:

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_web_stomp_examples
</pre>

The examples will be available under
[http://127.0.0.1:15670/](http://127.0.0.1:15670/) url. You will see two examples:

 * "echo" - shows how to use STOMP to do simple message broadcasting
 * "bunny" - example of a simple collaboration canvas painting app

We encourage you to take a look [at the source code](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-stomp-examples/tree/master/priv).

## Configuration

When no configuration is specified the Web STOMP plugin will listen on
all interfaces on port 15674 and have a default user login/passcode of
`guest`/`guest`. Note that this user is only [allowed to connect from localhost](/access-control.html) by default.
We highly recommend creating a separate user production systems.

To change this, edit your
[Configuration file](/configure.html#configuration-file),
to contain a `tcp_config` section with a `port` variable for the `rabbitmq_web_stomp` application.

For example, a complete configuration file which changes the listener
port to 12345 would look like:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[
  {rabbitmq_web_stomp,
      [{tcp_config, [{port, 12345}]}]}
].
</pre>

You can use the `tcp_config` section to specify any TCP option you need.
See the [RabbitMQ Networking guide](/networking.html) and [Ranch documentation](https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/ranch/1.3/manual/ranch_tcp/)
for details about accepted parameters.


### TLS (SSL)

The plugin supports WebSockets with TLS (WSS) connections. That requires
Erlang/OTP 17.5 or a later version.

TLS (SSL) configuration parameters are provided in the `ssl_config` section:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[
  {rabbitmq_web_stomp,
      [{ssl_config, [{port,       15671},
                     {backlog,    1024},
                     {certfile,   "path/to/certs/client/cert.pem"},
                     {keyfile,    "path/to/certs/client/key.pem"},
                     {cacertfile, "path/to/certs/testca/cacert.pem"},
                     %% needed when private key has a passphrase
                     {password,   "changeme"}]}]}
].
</pre>

Note that port, certfile, keyfile and password are all mandatory.
See the [TLS guide](/ssl.html) and [Ranch documentation](https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/ranch/1.3/manual/ranch_ssl/)
for details about accepted parameters.

A separate guide on [TLS Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting-ssl.html) is also available.

## WebSocket Options and Content Encoding

By default, the Web STOMP plugin will expect to handle messages
encoded as UTF-8. This cannot be changed for the SockJS endpoint,
however you can switch the WebSocket endpoint to binary if needed.
The `ws_frame` option serves this purpose:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[
  {rabbitmq_web_stomp, [{ws_frame, binary}]}
].
</pre>

The Web STOMP plugin uses the Cowboy web server under the hood.
Cowboy provides [a number of
options](https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/1.0/manual/cowboy_protocol/)
that can be used to customize the behavior of the server
w.r.t. WebSocket connection handling. You can specify those in the Web
STOMP plugin configuration, in the `cowboy_opts` section:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[
  {rabbitmq_web_stomp,
      [{cowboy_opts, [{max_keepalive, 10}]}]}
].
</pre>

The SockJS endpoint can also be configured further in the
`sockjs_opts` section of the configuration. Look into the
SockJS-erlang repository for a detailed [list of options](https://github.com/rabbitmq/sockjs-erlang#sockjs-erlang-api)
you can use. For example, to use a different SockJS client
version, you can use the following configuration:

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[
  {rabbitmq_web_stomp,
      [{sockjs_opts, [{sockjs_url, "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/sockjs/0.3.4/sockjs.min.js"}]}]}
].
</pre>

The `use_http_auth` option extends the authentication by
allowing clients to send the login and passcode in the
HTTP Authorization header (using HTTP Basic Auth). If
present, these credentials will be used. Otherwise, the
default STOMP credentials are used. The credentials found
in the CONNECT frame, if any, are ignored.

<pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[
  {rabbitmq_web_stomp,
      [{use_http_auth, true}]}
].
</pre>

## Missing features

RabbitMQ Web STOMP is fully compatible with the
[RabbitMQ STOMP](/stomp.html) plugin, with the exception of STOMP
heartbeats. STOMP heartbeats won't work with SockJS (WebSocket emulation).

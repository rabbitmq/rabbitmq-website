  <doc:heading>Managing the Broker</doc:heading>
  <p>
    To stop the server or check its status, etc., you can invoke
    <code>rabbitmqctl</code> (as an administrator). It should be
    available on the path. All <code>rabbitmqctl</code> commands will
    report the node absence if no broker is running.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Invoke <code>rabbitmqctl stop</code> to stop the server.</li>
    <li>Invoke <code>rabbitmqctl status</code> to check whether it is
      running.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    More <a href="man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html">info on rabbitmqctl</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Logging</h3>
  <p>
    Output from the server is sent to a
    <b>RABBITMQ_NODENAME</b>.log file in the
    <b>RABBITMQ_LOG_BASE</b> directory. Additional log data is
    written to <b>RABBITMQ_NODENAME</b>-sasl.log.
  </p>
  <p>
    The broker always appends to the log files, so a complete
    log history is retained.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use the <code>logrotate</code> program
    to do all necessary rotation and compression,
    and you can change it. By default,
    this script runs weekly on files located in default
    <code>/var/log/rabbitmq</code> directory. See
    <code>/etc/logrotate.d/rabbitmq-server</code>
    to configure
    <code>logrotate</code>.
  </p>

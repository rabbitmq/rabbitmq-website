    <title>Nightly Builds</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <p class="intro">
          We now produce nightly builds for the RabbitMQ broker
          and official client libraries. These builds are available
          so that users can try out the latest features and bug fixes
          as soon as they become available.
      </p>
      <doc:section name="stability-and-safety">
	  <p>
          Nightly builds are based on the 'master' branch of our GitHub
          repositories. This represents the <i>bleeding edge</i> and therefore
          should not be considered complete or completely stable. It is quite
          possible that existing features, APIs and/or configuration data
          formats have been changed in ways that are not backwards compatible
          or even removed altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
          In addition to the changes described above, it is also possible that
          incompatible changes have been made to the way persistent storage
          is handled. Such changes may mean that after installing a nightly
          build, your RabbitMQ installation <i>cannot be rolled back to a
          previous (stable) version</i>. To avoid conflicting with an existing
          installation, you should either remove it first, or configure the
          nightly build installation to use an alternative location for its
          persistent storage and (potentially) other configuration elements
          using the <a href="relocate.html">provided instructions</a>.
      </p>
      </doc:section>
      <doc:section name="packaging-repositories">
        <p>
          We publish a debian repository containing the nighty build artefacts,
          so that you can install them using the relevant package manager for
          your system. You should be aware that this repository will be
          overwritten each night, so you can <i>only</i> use the latest version
          when installing in this manner.
      </p>
      <p>
          As with our published live releases, we continue to digitally
          sign the nightly build artefacts using
          <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> and
          <a href="https://rabbitmq.com/rabbit-nightly-signing-key-public.asc">
              our nightly builds public signing key</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find documentation about any new features available in
        our nightly builds
        at <a href="http://next.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html">next.rabbitmq.com</a>.

    <title>Nightly Builds</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <p class="intro">
          We now produce nightly builds for the RabbitMQ broker. These builds
          are available so that users can try out the latest features and bug
          fixes as soon as they become available.
      </p>
      <doc:section name="stability-and-safety">
      <p>
          Nightly builds are based on both 'master' and 'stable' branches of
          our GitHub repositories. Both builds have been verified to be
          installable on several different operating systems.
      </p>
      <p>
          Master represents the <i>bleeding edge</i> and therefore
          should not be considered complete or completely stable. It is quite
          possible that existing features, APIs and/or configuration data
          formats have been changed in ways that are not backwards compatible
          or even removed altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
          Stable nightlies include unscrutinised recent commits on top of the
          latest 'stable' release, and should not be considered release
          quality.
      </p>
      <p>
          In addition to the changes described above, it is also possible that
          incompatible changes have been made to the way persistent storage
          is handled. Such changes may mean that after installing a nightly
          build, your RabbitMQ installation <i>cannot be rolled back to a
          previous (stable) version</i>. To avoid conflicting with an existing
          installation, you should either remove it first, or configure the
          nightly build installation to use an alternative location for its
          persistent storage and (potentially) other configuration elements
          using the <a href="relocate.html">provided instructions</a>.
      </p>
      </doc:section>
      <doc:section name="packaging-repositories">
        <p>
          We publish debian repositories containing the nighty build artefacts,
          so that you can install them using the relevant package manager for
          your system.
      </p>
      <p>
          As with our published live releases, we continue to digitally
          sign the nightly build artefacts using
          <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> and
          <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc">
              our regular public signing key</a> (we no longer have a separate
              key for nightlies).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find documentation about any new features available in
        our nightly builds
        at <a href="//next.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html">next.rabbitmq.com</a>.

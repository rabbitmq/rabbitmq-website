        This page describes the way we work with Git on the
        RabbitMQ project.

        <p>
          We use Git on the RabbitMQ project to manage almost
          all of our source-code.

      <doc:section name="branch-per-bug">
        <doc:heading>Branching policy: Branch per issue</doc:heading>
        <p>
          We use the technique of <i>branch per issue</i> when
          developing RabbitMQ code, where each feature or bug fix is
          developed on a branch of its own (using <code>git checkout
            -b</code>) and merged into the <code>master</code> or
          <code>stable</code> branches only when it passes QA. Branches
          follow the pattern <code><i>repository-name</i>-<i>NN</i></code>,
          where <i>repository-name</i> is the name of the GitHub project
          where the issue was filed (eg. <code>rabbitmq-dotnet-client</code>)
          and <i>NN</i> is the GitHub issue number. The purpose of
          prepending the repository owning the issue is that an issue
          may require changes to several projects. There are also
          branches named <code>bug<i>NNNNN</i></code> for issues in the
          original Bugzilla tracker (which is not public).
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="pull-requests">
        <doc:heading>Pull Requests and the Review/QA Process</doc:heading>
        <p>
          Branches that are ready to be reviewed and/or QA'ed should
          be submitted as pull requests. Feedback is then given in
          the comments. After receiving feedback, update the original
          branch and push it: GitHub will take care of updating the pull
          request. Then the process goes on until the pull request is
          merged or closed (e.g. because a feature is rejected after an
          attempt to implement it).
        </p>
        <p>
          The pull request must be made against the <code>stable</code>
          branch if it is a bugfix involving no incompatible changes
          with the latest stable release (ie. no changes to the Mnesia
          schema or the inter-node communication), or the <code>master</code>
          branch for everything else.
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="default-branch">
        <doc:heading>The master branch</doc:heading>
        <p>
          The <code>master</code> branch contains all the work that
          has been QA'd so far that is scheduled to appear in the next
          release. The <code>master</code> branch of each RabbitMQ
          repository is usually roughly in sync with the
          <code>master</code> branches of the others. Generally, you
          can track QA'd development work by tracking the
          <code>master</code> branches of the RabbitMQ repositories
          of interest.
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="maintenance-branches">
        <doc:heading>Maintenance branch</doc:heading>
        <p>
          There's a separate branch for maintenance work,
          <code>stable</code>. It plays the same role as the
          <code>master</code> branch except that it carries merged,
          QA'd code intended for the next bug-fix release rather than
          the next general release.
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="tags">
        <doc:heading>Tags</doc:heading>
        <p>
          We also use tags to give names to snapshots of the state of
          the code. Generally, both the core repositories and the
          repositories of plugins intended to work with the named
          snapshot are tagged.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you are using RabbitMQ server version 3.4.4,
          then examining the output of <code>git tag</code> in a copy
          of <code>rabbitmq-stomp</code> gives:
        </p>
        <pre>$ git tag
# omitted for brevity
rabbitmq_v3_3_5
rabbitmq_v3_4_0
rabbitmq_v3_4_1
rabbitmq_v3_4_2
rabbitmq_v3_4_3
rabbitmq_v3_4_4
        </pre>
        <p>
          It's important to make sure that all the repositories you
          are using are on the same tag as each other. Continuing with
          our example of server version 3.4.4, you could make sure
          your checkout of <code>rabbitmq-stomp</code> was at the
          <code>rabbitmq_v3_4_4</code> tag by using <code>git
          checkout</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>git checkout rabbitmq_v3_4_4</pre>
        <p>
          At this point, you could proceed with compiling the plugin
          as explained in the plugin's documentation.

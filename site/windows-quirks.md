# Windows-specific Issues

This guide is a companion to the main [Windows installation guide](/install-windows.html).

It documents known conditions and scenarios which can cause RabbitMQ Windows service
or CLI tools to malfunction.


## <a id="erlang-distribution-port" class="anchor" href="#erlang-distribution-port">Erlang Distribution Port</a>

To specify a non-standard port to be used for Erlang distribution, do the following:

 * Make sure to use the same administrative user that was used to install RabbitMQ
 * Stop the RabbitMQ Windows service using `.\rabbitmq-service.bat stop`
 * Remove the RabbitMQ Windows service using `.\rabbitmq-service.bat remove`
 * Create the `%AppData%\RabbitMQ\rabbitmq-env-conf.bat` file with the following contents (use your own port number):

<pre class="lang-text">
set DIST_PORT=44556
</pre>

 * Install the RabbitMQ Windows service using `.\rabbitmq-service.bat install`
 * Start the RabbitMQ Windows service using `.\rabbitmq-service.bat start`
 * Verify what port is being used for inter-node and CLI tool communication:

<pre class="lang-bash">
epmd -names
</pre>

## <a id="multiple-erlang-versions" class="anchor" href="#multiple-erlang-versions">Multiple Versions of Erlang May Cause Installation Issues</a>

Due to how the Windows `.exe` installer detects an installed version of Erlang, RabbitMQ may end up not using the latest version of Erlang installed. Please ensure that only one version of Erlang is installed -
the version you wish RabbitMQ to use. If you must upgrade Erlang, use this procedure:

 * Make sure to use the same administrative user that was used to install RabbitMQ
 * Stop the RabbitMQ Windows service using `.\rabbitmq-service.bat stop`
 * Uninstall Erlang
 * Install the new version of Erlang
 * Open the "RabbitMQ Command Prompt (sbin dir)" start menu item and run the commands below to reinstall the Windows service

<pre class="lang-powershell">
.\rabbitmq-service.bat remove
.\rabbitmq-service.bat install
.\rabbitmq-service.bat start
</pre>

If any environment variables have changed in the mean time, [Windows service reinstallation](/configure.html#rabbitmq-env-file-windows) would
also be necessary.


## <a id="non-ascii-paths" class="anchor" href="#non-ascii-paths">Cannot Install to a Path with non-ASCII Characters</a>

RabbitMQ will fail to start with the error that reads

<pre class="lang-text">
RabbitMQ: Erlang machine stopped instantly (distribution name conflict?)
</pre>

when installed to a path with non-ASCII characters in it.
This is because we need to pass the location of the compiled Erlang files to the Erlang VM.
It expects input in UTF-8, but the console will typically use some other encoding.

### Mitigation

One of these options can be used to mitigate:

 * Override `RABBITMQ_BASE` to point to a directory
   that only has ASCII characters and [**re-install** the Windows service](/configure.html#rabbitmq-env-file-windows).
 * Edit the file `rabbitmq-server.bat` and change the
   line `set TDP0=%~dp0` to `set TDP0=%~dps0`.
   This will use short paths (the infamous `C:\PROGRA~1`) everywhere.


## <a id="non-ascii-cli" class="anchor" href="#non-ascii-cli">CLI Tools Display or Parse non-ASCII Characters Incorrectly</a>

Similarly, [RabbitMQ CLI tools](/cli.html) will expect command line
parameters to be encoded in UTF-8, and display strings as
UTF-8. The console will instead provide and expect some country-specific encoding.

### Mitigation

One of these options can be used to mitigate:

 * Avoid using non-ASCII characters in RabbitMQ installation and [node directory](/relocate.html) paths
 * On recent versions of Windows, issue the command 
   <pre class="lang-powershell">chcp 65001</pre> before using CLI tools to force
   the console to use UTF-8
 * Where possible, use the [management plugin](/management.html) instead of CLI tools.


## <a id="cookie-location" class="anchor" href="#cookie-location">Installing as a non-administrator User Leaves `.erlang.cookie` in the Wrong Place</a>

If RabbitMQ is installed using a non-administrative account, a [shared secret](/cli.html#erlang-cookie) file
used by nodes and CLI tools will not be placed into a correct location,
leading to [authentication failures](/cli.html#cli-authentication-failures) when `rabbitmqctl.bat`
and other CLI tools are used.

### Mitigation

One of these options can be used to mitigate:

 * Re-install RabbitMQ using an administrative user
 * Copy the file `.erlang.cookie` manually
   from `%SystemRoot%` or `%SystemRoot%\system32\config\systemprofile`
   to `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%`.

See [How CLI Tools Authenticate to Nodes (and Nodes to Each Other](/cli.html#erlang-cookie) in the CLI guide.


## <a id="computername-vs-hostname" class="anchor" href="#computername-vs-hostname">COMPUTERNAME is different from HOSTNAME</a>

Older versions of RabbitMQ calculated the node name using the `COMPUTERNAME`
environment variable, which is always upper-case. Later versions of RabbitMQ
use `HOSTNAME` which may be lowercase. If you are upgrading from an old
(pre-`3.6.0`) version of RabbitMQ to a current one and see [the issue described
here](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1568), you should set
a system-wide environment variable named `RABBITMQ_NODENAME` with the following
value:

```
rabbit@ALL_CAPS_HOSTNAME
```

Then, RabbitMQ will continue to use the all-caps hostname and your upgrade will
succeed.

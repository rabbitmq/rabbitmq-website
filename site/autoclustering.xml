      <p>
        A RabbitMQ cluster can formed in a number of ways:

        <ul>
          <li>Declaratively by listing cluster nodes in <a href="/configure.html">config file</a></li>
          <li>Declaratively using DNS-based discovery</li>
          <li>
            Declaratively using <a href="https://github.com/aweber/rabbitmq-autocluster/">rabbitmq-autocluster</a> (a plugin),
            which supports AWS peer discovery (tags and autoscaling group membership-based), etcd, Consul, and more backends.
          </li>
          <li>Manually with <code>rabbitmqctl</code></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        When a node starts and detects it doesn't have a previously
        initialised database, it will check if there's a peer
        discovery mechanism configured. If that's the case, it will
        then perform the discovery and attempt to contact each
        discovered peer in order. Finally, it will attempt to join the
        cluster of the first reachable peer.
      </p>

      <p>
        If peer discovery isn't configured, or it fails, or no peers are reachable,
        the node will initialise from scratch and proceed as a standalone node.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a node previously was a cluster member, it will try to contact
        its "last seen" peer for a period of time. In this case, no peer discovery
        is performed.

      <doc:heading>Peer Discovery</doc:heading>

      <p>
        To form a cluster, new ("blank") nodes need to be able to discover their
        peers. As of RabbitMQ 3.7.0, peer discovery mechanisms are pluggable.
        There are two implementations available out of the box:

        <ul>
          <li>Config file-based (a.k.a. the "classic config" backend)</li>
          <li>DNS-based</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The discovery mechanism to use is specified in the <a
        href="/configure.html">config file</a>, as are
        mechanism-specific settings, for example, discovery service
        hostnames, credentials, and so on.
        <code>autocluster.peer_discovery_backend</code> is the key
        that controls what discovery module (implementation) is used.
        The module has to implement the <a
        href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/master/src/rabbit_peer_discovery.erl">rabbit_peer_discovery_backend</a>
        behaviour. Plugins therefore can introduce their own discovery
        mechanisms.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="peer_discovery_classic_config">
      <doc:heading>Config File Peer Discovery Backend</doc:heading>

      <p>
        The most basic way for a node to discover its cluster peers is to read a list
        of nodes from the config file. This feature has been available in RabbitMQ for a number
        of years, even before pluggable peer discovery backends were introduced in <code>3.7.0</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is done using the <code>autocluster.classic_config.nodes</code> config setting.

        <pre class="sourcecode">
autocluster.peer_discovery_backend = rabbit_peer_discovery_classic_config

autocluster.classic_config.nodes.1 = rabbit@hostname1.eng.example.local
autocluster.classic_config.nodes.2 = rabbit@hostname2.eng.example.local
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        The following example demonstrates the same configuration in
        the classic config format. The 2nd member of the
        <code>rabbit.cluster_nodes</code> tuple is the node type to
        use for the current node. In the vast majority of cases all
        nodes should be <code>disc</code> nodes.

        <pre class="sourcecode">
[
 {rabbit, [
           {cluster_nodes, {['rabbit@hostname1.eng.example.local',
                             'rabbit@hostname2.eng.example.local'], disc}}
          ]}
].

        </pre>
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="peer_discovery_dns">
      <doc:heading>DNS Peer Discovery Backend</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Another built-in peer discovery mechanism as of RabbitMQ 3.7.0 is DNS-based.
        It relies on a pre-configured hostname ("seed hostname") with DNS A records and reverse DNS lookups
        to perform peer discovery. More specifically, this mechanism will perform the following steps:

        <ul>
          <li>Query DNS A records of the seed hostname.</li>
          <li>For each returned DNS record's IP address, perform a reverse DNS lookup.</li>
          <li>
            Append current node's prefix (e.g. <code>rabbit</code> in <code>rabbit@hostname1.example.local</code>)
            to each hostname and return the result.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, let's consider a seed hostname of
        <code>discovery.eng.example.local</code>.  It has 2 DNS A
        records that return two IP addresses:
        <code>192.168.100.1</code> and
        <code>192.168.100.2</code>. Reverse DNS lookups for those IP
        addresses return <code>node1.eng.example.local</code> and
        <code>node2.eng.example.local</code>, respectively. Current node's name is not
        set and defaults to <code>rabbit@$(hostname)</code>.
        The final list of nodes discovered will contain two nodes: <code>node2.eng.example.local</code>
        and <code>node2.eng.example.local</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The seed hostname is set using the <code>autocluster.dns.hostname</code> config setting:

        <pre class="sourcecode">
autocluster.peer_discovery_backend = rabbit_peer_discovery_dns

autocluster.dns.hostname = discovery.eng.example.local
        </pre>
      </p>

      <doc:heading>Other Peer Discovery Backends</doc:heading>

      <p>
        There are more peer discovery backends available via community plugins.
        In fact, the idea of pluggable peer discovery was ported into RabbitMQ core from a plugin developed
        by <a href="https://github.com/gmr">Gavin Roy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aweber/rabbitmq-autocluster">rabbitmq-autocluster</a>.

        Some of the mechanisms provided by plugins include

        <ul>
          <li>AWS (EC2 API)-based discovery, using instance tags or autoscaling group membership</li>
          <li>etcd</li>
          <li>Consul</li>
        </ul>

        and others.

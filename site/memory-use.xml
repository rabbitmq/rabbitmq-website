      <doc:heading>Introduction</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Operators need to be able to reason about node's memory use,
        both absolute and relative ("what uses most memory"). This is an
        important aspect of <a href="/monitoring.html">system monitoring</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        RabbitMQ provides tools that report and help analyse node memory use:

        <ul class="plain">
          <li><code>rabbitmqctl status</code> provides a memory breakdown section</li>
          <li><a href="/management.html">management UI</a> provides the same breakdown on the node page as <code>rabbitmqctl status</code></li>
          <li><a href="/management.html#http-api">HTTP API</a> provides the same information as the management UI, useful for <a href="/monitoring.html">monitoring</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-top">rabbitmq-top</a>, a plugin inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_(software)">top</a> utility</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Obtaining a node memory breakdown should be the first step when reasoning about node memory use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that all measurements are somewhat approximate, based on values
        returned by the underlying runtime or the kernel at a specific point in
        time, usually within a 5 seconds time window.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="strategies">
      <doc:heading>Total Memory Use Calculation Strategies</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Starting with version 3.6.11, different strategies can be used
        to compute how much memory a node uses. Historically, nodes
        obtained this information from the runtime, reporting how much
        memory is used (not just allocated). This strategy, known as
        <code>legacy</code> (alias for <code>erlang</code>) tends to
        underreport and is not recommended.
      </p>
      <p>
          Effective strategy is configured using the <code>vm_memory_calculation_strategy</code> key.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>rss</code> uses OS-specific means of querying the kernel to find
        RSS (Resident Set Size) value of the node OS process. This strategy is most precise
        and used by default on Linux, MacOS, BSD and Solaris systems. When
        this strategy is used, RabbitMQ runs short lived subprocesses once a second.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>allocated</code> is a strategy that queries runtime memory allocator
        information. It is usually quite close to the values reported by the <code>rss</code>
        strategy. This strategy is used by default on Windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>vm_memory_calculation_strategy</code> setting also impacts
        memory breakdown reporting. If set to <code>legacy</code> (<code>erlang</code>) or <code>allocated</code>,
        some memory breakdown fields will not be reported. This is covered in more detail
        further in this guide.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following config example uses the <code>rss</code> strategy:

        <pre class="sourcecode ini">
vm_memory_calculation_strategy = rss
</pre>

        Similarly, for the <code>allocated</code> strategy, use:

        <pre class="sourcecode ini">
vm_memory_calculation_strategy = allocated
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        To configure the <code>rss</code> strategy using classic config format:

        <pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[
  {rabbit, [{vm_memory_calculation_strategy, rss}]}
].
</pre>

        Similarly, for the <code>allocated</code> strategy, use:

        <pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[
  {rabbit, [{vm_memory_calculation_strategy, allocated}]}
].
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        To find out what strategy a node uses, see its <a href="/configure.html">effective configuration</a>.

      <doc:heading>Memory Use Breakdown</doc:heading>

      <doc:subsection name="breakdown-intro">
        <doc:heading>How Memory Breakdown Works</doc:heading>

        <p>
          Memory use breakdown reports allocated memory distribution by category:

          <ul class="plain">
            <li>Connections (further split into three categories: readers, writers, other)</li>
            <li>Channels</li>
            <li>Queue master replicas</li>
            <li>Queue mirror replicas</li>
            <li>Message Store and Indices</li>
            <li>Binaries</li>
            <li>Node-local metrics (stats database)</li>
            <li>Internal database tables</li>
            <li>Plugins</li>
            <li>Memory allocated but not yet used</li>
            <li>Code (bytecode, module metadata)</li>
            <li>ETS (in memory key/value store) tables</li>
            <li>Atom tables</li>
            <li>Other</li>
          </ul>

          Generally there is no overlap between the categories (no double accounting for the same memory).
          Plugins and runtime versions may affect this.

        <p>
          Management UI can be used to produce a memory breakdown chart. This information is available on the
          node metrics page that can be accessed from Overview:

          <img src="img/memory/mgmt-ui-node-list.png" alt="Cluster node list in management UI" title="Cluster node list in management UI" />
        </p>



        <p>
          On the node metrics page, scroll down to the memory breakdown buttons:

        </p>



        <p>
          Memory and binary heap breakdowns can be expensive to calculate and are produced on demand when the <code>Update</code> button is pressed:

          Internal database (Mnesia) tables keep an in-memory copy of all its data (even on disc
          nodes). Typically this will only be large when there are a
          large number of queues, exchanges, bindings, users or
          virtual hosts. Plugins can store data in the same database as well.

      <doc:heading>Per-process Analysis with rabbitmq-top</doc:heading>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-top">rabbitmq-top</a> is a plugin that helps
        identify runtime processes ("lightweight threads") that consume most memory or scheduler (CPU)
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The plugin ships with RabbitMQ. Enable it with

        <pre class="sourcecode bash">
[sudo] rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_top
</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        The plugin adds new administrative tabs to the <a href="/management.html">management UI</a>. One
        tab displays top processes by one of the metrics:

        <ul>
          <li>Memory used</li>
          <li>Reductions (unit of scheduler/CPU consumption)</li>
          <li>Erlang mailbox length</li>
          <li>For <code>gen_server2</code> processes, internal operation buffer length</li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
        Second tab displays ETS (internal key/value store) tables. The tables can be sorted by
        the amount of memory used or number of rows:

    <doc:section name="memory-breakdown-and-monitoring">
      <doc:heading>Memory Use Monitoring</doc:heading>

      <p>
        It is recommended that production systems monitor memory usage of all cluster nodes,
        ideally with a breakdown, together with <a href="/monitoring.html">infrastructure-level metrics</a>.
        By correlating breakdown categories with other metrics, e.g. the number of concurrent
        connections or enqueued messages, it becomes possible to detect problems that
        stem from a application-specific behavior (e.g. connection leaks or ever growing queues without consumers).
      </p>

    <doc:section name="breakdown-preallocated-memory">
      <doc:heading>Preallocated memory</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Erlang memory breakdown reports only memory is currently being used, and not
        the memory that has been allocated for later use or reserved by the operating system.
        OS tools like <code>ps</code> can report more memory used than the runtime.

        This memory consists of allocated but not used,
        as well as unallocated but reserved by the OS. Both values depend on the OS and Erlang VM allocator
        settings and can fluctuate significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the sections depend on the <code>vm_memory_calculation_strategy</code> setting.
        If the strategy is set to <code>erlang</code>, unused
        memory will not be reported.
        If memory calculation strategy is set to <code>allocated</code>, memory
        reserved by OS will not be reported. Therefore <code>rss</code> is the strategy
        that provides most information from both the kernel and the runtime.
      </p>

      <p>
        Runtime's memory allocator behavior can be tuned, please refer to

          <p>A message has multiple parts that use up memory:</p>

          <ul class="plain">
            <li>Payload - >= 1 byte - variable size, typically few hundred bytes to a few hundred kilobytes</li>

            <li>RabbitMQ message ordering structure - 16 bytes</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Messages with a 1KB payload will use up 2KB of memory once attributes and metadata is factored in.</p>

          <p>Some messages can be stored on disk, but still have their metadata kept in memory.</p>

        <doc:subsection name="queue-memory-usage">
          <doc:heading>How much memory does a queue use?</doc:heading>

          <p>A message has multiple parts that use up memory:</p>

          <p>A queue is an Erlang process. If a queue is mirrored, each mirror is a separate Erlang process.</p>

          <p>
            Since a queues master is a single Erlang process, message ordering can be guaranteed.
            Multiple queues means multiple Erlang processes which get an even amount of CPU time.
            This ensures that no queue can block other queues.
          </p>

          <p>
            The memory use of a single queue can be obtained via the HTTP API:

<pre class="sourcecode json">
curl -s -u guest:guest http://127.0.0.1:15672/api/queues/%2f/queue-name |
  python -m json.tool

{
    ..
    "memory": 97921904,
    ...
    "message_bytes_ram": 2153429941,
    ...
}
</pre>
          </p>

          <ul class="plain">
            <li><code>memory</code> - memory used by the queue process, accounts message metadata (at least 720 bytes per message), does not account for message payloads over 64 bytes</li>
            <li><code>message_bytes_ram</code> - memory used by the message payloads, regardless of size</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If messages are small, message metadata can use more memory than the message payload.
            10,000 messages with 1 byte of payload will use 10KB of <code>message_bytes_ram</code> (payload) &amp; 7MB of <code>memory</code> (metadata).
          </p>

          <p>
            If message payloads are large, they will not be reflected in the queue process memory.
            10,000 messages with 100 KB of payload will use 976MB of <code>message_bytes_ram</code> (payload) &amp; 7MB of <code>memory</code> (metadata).
          </p>
        </doc:subsection>

        <doc:subsection name="queue-memory-usage">
          <doc:heading>Why does the queue memory grow and shrink when publishing/consuming?</doc:heading>

          <p>
            Erlang uses <a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/erlang-19-0-garbage-collector.html" target="_blank">generational garbage collection</a> for each Erlang process.
            Garbage collection is done per queue, independently of all other Erlang processes.
          </p>

          <p>
            When garbage collection runs, it will copy used process memory before deallocating unused memory.
            This can can lead to the queue process using up to twice as much memory during garbage collection, as shown here (queue contains a lot of messages):

            <img src="img/memory/queue-memory-usage-spikes.png" alt="Queue under load memory usage" title="Queue under load memory usage" />
          </p>
        </doc:subsection>

        <doc:subsection name="queue-memory-usage">
          <doc:heading>Can queue memory growth during garbage collection be dangerous?</doc:heading>
          <p>
            If Erlang VM tries to allocate more memory than is available, the VM itself will either crash or be killed by the OOM killer.
            When the Erlang VM crashes, RabbitMQ will lose all non-persistent data.
          </p>

          <p>
            High memory watermark blocks publishers and prevents new messages from being enqueued.
            Since garbage collection can double the memory used by a queue, it is unsafe to set the high memory watermark above <code>0.5</code>.
            The default high memory watermark is set to <code>0.4</code> since this is safer as not all memory is used by queues.
            This is entirely workload specific, which differs across RabbitMQ deployments.
          </p>

          <p>
            We recommend many queues so that memory allocation / garbage collection is spread across many Erlang processes.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the messages in a queue take up a lot of memory, we recommend lazy queues so that they are stored on disk as soon as possible and not kept in memory longer than is necessary.

# RabbitMQ MQTT Adapter NOSYNTAX

This is a protocol adapter that allows MQTT-capable clients to
connect to a RabbitMQ broker. The adapter translates MQTT 3.1
methods into their AMQP equivalents and back.

Announcements regarding the adapter are periodically made on the
[RabbitMQ mailing list](http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss)
and [blog](http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog).

## <a id="smf"/> Supported MQTT 3.1 features

* QoS0 and QoS1 publish & consume
* Last Will and Testament (LWT)
* TLS/SSL
* Session stickiness
* Retained messages with pluggable storage backends

## <a id="ifb"/>Enabling the Plugin

The MQTT adapter is included in the RabbitMQ distribution. To enable
it, use [rabbitmq-plugins](/man/rabbitmq-plugins.1.man.html):

    rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_mqtt

After the plugin has been enabled, RabbitMQ needs restarting.

## <a id="overview"/> How it Works

RabbitMQ MQTT plugin targets MQTT 3.1 and supports a broad range
of MQTT clients. It also makes it possible for MQTT clients to interoperate
with [AMQP 0-9-1, AMQP 1.0, and STOMP](https://www.rabbitmq.com/protocols.html) clients.

The plugin builds on top of RabbitMQ exchanges and queues. Messages published
to MQTT topics use a topic exchange (`amq.topic` by default) internally. Subscribers consume from
RabbitMQ queues bound to the topic exchange. This both enables interoperability
with other protocols and makes it possible to use the [Management plugin](/management.html)
to inspect queue sizes, message rates, and so on.


### <a id="durability"/> Subscription Durability

MQTT 3.1 assumes two primary usage scenarios:

 * Transient clients that use transient (non-persistent) messages
 * Stateful clients that use durable subscriptions (non-clean sessions, QoS1)

This section briefly covers how these scenarios map to RabbitMQ queue durability and persistence
features.

Transient (QoS0) subscription use non-durable, auto-delete queues
that will be deleted when the client disconnects.

Durable (QoS1) subscriptions use durable queues. Whether the queues are
auto-deleted is controlled by the client's clean session flag. Clients with
clean sessions use auto-deleted queues, others use non-auto-deleted ones.

For transient (QoS0) publishes, the plugin will publish messages as transient
(non-persistent). Naturally, for durable (QoS1) publishes, persistent
messages will be used internally.

Queues created for MQTT subscribers will have names starting with `mqtt-subscription-`,
one per subscription QoS level. The queues will have [queue TTL](/ttl.html) depending
on MQTT plugin configuration.


## <a id="config"/> Plugin Configuration

Here is a sample configuration that sets every MQTT option:

    [{rabbit,        [{tcp_listeners,    [5672]}]},
     {rabbitmq_mqtt, [{default_user,     <<"guest">>},
                      {default_pass,     <<"guest">>},
                      {allow_anonymous,  true},
                      {vhost,            <<"/">>},
                      {exchange,         <<"amq.topic">>},
                      {subscription_ttl, 1800000},
                      {prefetch,         10},
                      {ssl_listeners,    []},
                      %% Default MQTT with TLS port is 8883
                      %% {ssl_listeners,    [8883]}
                      {tcp_listeners,    [1883]},
                      {tcp_listen_options, [binary,
                                            {packet,    raw},
                                            {reuseaddr, true},
                                            {backlog,   128},
                                            {nodelay,   true}]}]}
    ].

### <a id="authentication"/> Authentication

The `default_user` and `default_pass` options are used to authenticate
the adapter in case MQTT clients provide no login credentials. If the
`allow_anonymous` option is set to `false` then clients MUST provide credentials.
The presence of client-supplied credentials over the network overrides
the `allow_anonymous` option. Colons may not appear in usernames.

The `vhost` option controls which RabbitMQ vhost the adapter connects to. The `vhost`
configuration is only consulted if no vhost is provided during connection establishment.
You can optionally specify a vhost while connecting, by prepending the vhost
to the username and separating with a colon.

For example, connecting with

    /:guest

is equivalent to the default vhost and username.

    mqtt-vhost:mqtt-username

means connecting to the vhost `mqtt-host` with username `mqtt-username`.

### Host and Port

The `tcp_listeners` and `tcp_listen_options` options are interpreted in the same way
as the corresponding options in the `rabbit` section, as explained in the
[broker configuration documentation](http://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html).

### TLS/SSL

The `ssl_listeners` option in the `rabbitmq_mqtt` config section controls the
endpoint (if any) that the adapter accepts SSL connections on. The
default MQTT SSL port is 8883. If this option is non-empty then the
`rabbit` section of the configuration file must contain an
`ssl_options` entry:

    [{rabbit,        [
                      {ssl_options, [{cacertfile, "/path/to/tls/ca/cacert.pem"},
                                     {certfile,   "/path/to/tls/server/cert.pem"},
                                     {keyfile,    "/path/to/tls/server/key.pem"},
                                     {verify,     verify_peer},
                                     {fail_if_no_peer_cert, true}]}
                     ]},
     {rabbitmq_mqtt, [
                      {ssl_listeners,    [8883]}
                      {tcp_listeners,    [1883]}
                      ]}
    ].

See the [SSL configuration guide](http://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html) for details.



### <a id="cta.ssl"/>Authentication with SSL client certificates

The MQTT adapter can authenticate SSL-based connections by extracting
a name from the client's SSL certificate, without using a password.

For safety the server must be configured with the SSL options
`fail_if_no_peer_cert` set to `true` and `verify` set to `verify_peer`, to
force all SSL clients to have a verifiable client certificate.

To switch this feature on, set `ssl_cert_login` to `true` for the
`rabbitmq_mqtt` application. For example:

    [
      {rabbitmq_mqtt, [{ssl_cert_login, true}]}
    ].

By default this will set the username to an RFC4514-ish string form of
the certificate's subject's Distinguished Name, similar to that
produced by OpenSSL's "-nameopt RFC2253" option.

To use the Common Name instead, add:

    {rabbit, [{ssl_cert_login_from, common_name}]}

to your configuration.

Note that:

* The authenticated user must exist in the configured authentication / authorisation backend(s).
* Clients must **not** supply username and password.




### <a id="stickiness"/> Session Stickiness (Clean and Non-clean Sessions)

The `subscription_ttl` option controls the lifetime of non-clean sessions. This
option is interpreted in the same way as the [queue TTL](http://www.rabbitmq.com/ttl.html#queue-ttl)
parameter, so the value `1800000` means 30 minutes.

The `prefetch` option controls the maximum number of unacknowledged messages that
will be delivered. This option is interpreted in the same way as the [AMQP 0-9-1 prefetch-count](http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.qos.prefetch-count)
field, so a value of `0` means "no limit".



### Custom Exchanges

The `exchange` option determines which exchange messages from MQTT clients are published
to. If a non-default exchange is chosen then it must be created before clients
publish any messages. The exchange is expected to be a topic exchange.



## <a id="retained"/> Retained Messages and Stores

The plugin supports retained messages. Message store implementation is pluggable
and the plugin ships with two implementation out of the box:

 * ETS-based (in memory), implemented in the <code>rabbit_mqtt_retained_msg_store_ets</code> module
 * DETS-based (on disk), implemented in the <code>rabbit_mqtt_retained_msg_store_dets</code>

Both implementations have limitations and trade-offs.
With the first one, maximum number of messages that can be retained is limited by RAM.
With the second one, there is a limit of 2 GB per vhost. Both are node-local
(messages retained on one broker node are not replicated to other nodes in the cluster).

To configure the store, use <code>rabbitmq_mqtt.retained_message_store</code> configuration key:

    [{rabbitmq_mqtt, [{default_user,     <<"guest">>},
                      {default_pass,     <<"guest">>},
                      {allow_anonymous,  true},
                      {vhost,            <<"/">>},
                      {exchange,         <<"amq.topic">>},
                      {subscription_ttl, 1800000},
                      {prefetch,         10},
                      %% use DETS (disk-based) store for retained messages
                      {retained_message_store, rabbit_mqtt_retained_msg_store_dets},
                      %% only used by DETS store
                      {retained_message_store_dets_sync_interval, 2000},
                      {ssl_listeners,    []},
                      {tcp_listeners,    [1883]}]}
    ].

The value must be a module that implements the store:

 * <code>rabbit_mqtt_retained_msg_store_ets</code> for RAM-based
 * <code>rabbit_mqtt_retained_msg_store_dets</code> for disk-based

These implementations are suitable for development but sometimes won't be for production needs.
MQTT 3.1 specification does not define consistency or replication requirements for retained
message stores, therefore RabbitMQ allows for custom ones to meet the consistency and
availability needs of a particular environment. For example, stores based on [Riak](http://basho.com/riak/)
and [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) would be suitable for most production environments as
those data stores provide [tunable consistency](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/advanced/replication-properties/).

Message stores must implement the <code>rabbit_mqtt_retained_msg_store</code> behaviour.


## <a id="limitations"/> Limitations

### Overlapping Subscriptions

Overlapping subscriptions from the same client
(e.g. `/sports/football/epl/#` and `/sports/football/#`) can result in
duplicate messages being delivered. Applications
need to account for this.

### Retained Message Stores

See Retained Messages above. Different retained message stores have
different benefits, trade-offs, and limitations.

      <doc:heading>Introduction</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Data services such as RabbitMQ often have many tunable
        parameters. Some configurations make a lot of sense for
        development but are not really suitable for production.  No
        single configuration fits every use case.  It is, therefore,
        important to assess your configuration before going into
        production. This guide aims to help with that.

      <doc:heading>Virtual Hosts, Users, Permissions</doc:heading>

      <doc:subsection name="virtual-hosts">
        <doc:heading>Virtual Hosts</doc:heading>
        <p>
          In a single-tenant environment, for example, when your RabbitMQ
          cluster is dedicated to power a single system in production,
          using default virtual host (<code>/</code>) is perfectly fine.
        </p>

        <p>
          In multi-tenant environments, use a separate vhost for
          each tenant/environment, e.g. <code>project1_development</code>,
          <code>project1_production</code>, <code>project2_development</code>,
          <code>project2_production</code>, and so on.
        </p>
      </doc:subsection>

      <doc:subsection name="users">
        <doc:heading>Users</doc:heading>
        <p>
          For production environments, delete the default user (<code>guest</code>).
          Default user only can connect from localhost by default, because it has well-known
          credentials. Instead of enabling remote connections, consider using a separate user
          with administrative permissions and a generated password.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is recommended to use a separate user per application. For example, if you
          have a mobile app, a Web app, and a data aggregation system, you'd have 3
          separate users. This makes a number of things easier:

          <ul>
            <li>Correlating client connections with applications</li>
            <li>Using <a href="/access-control.html">fine-grained permissions</a></li>
            <li>Credentials roll-over (e.g. periodically or in case of a breach)</li>
          </ul>

          In case there are many instances of the same application, there's a trade-off
          between better security (having a set of credentials per instance) and convenience
          of provisioning (sharing a set of credentials between some or all instances).

          For IoT applications that involve many clients performing the same or similar
          function and having fixed IP addresses, it may make sense to <a href="/ssl.html">authenticate
          using x509 certificates</a> or <a href="https://github.com/gotthardp/rabbitmq-auth-backend-ip-range">source IP addresse ranges</a>.

    <doc:section name="inter-node-authentication">
      <doc:heading>Inter-node Authentication</doc:heading>

      <p>
        RabbitMQ nodes authenticate to each other using a <a href="/clustering.html#erlang-cookie">shared secret</a>
        stored in a file. It is important that the value is generated in a reasonably secure way
        (e.g. not computed from an easy to guess value). This is usually done using deployment
        automation tools at the time of initial deployment. Those tools can use default or
        placeholder values: don't rely on them.
      </p>

      <p>
        CLI tools use the same authentication mechanism. It is recommended that
        <a href="/clustering.html#selinux-ports">inter-node and CLI communication port</a> access is limited to the hosts that run
        RabbitMQ nodes or CLI tools.
      </p>
    </doc:section>


    <doc:section name="resource-limits">
      <doc:heading>Resource Limits and Monitoring</doc:heading>

      <p>
        RabbitMQ uses <a href="/alarms.html">Resource-driven alarms</a>
        to throttle publishers when consumers do not keep up.
        It is important to evaluate resource limit configurations before
        going into production.
      </p>

      <doc:subsection name="resource-limits-ram">
        <doc:heading>Memory</doc:heading>
        <p>
          By default, RabbitMQ will not accept any new messages when it detects
          that it's using more than 40% of the available memory (as reported by the OS):
          <code>{vm_memory_high_watermark, 0.4}</code>. This is a safe default
          and care should be taken when modifying this value, even when the
          host is a dedicated RabbitMQ node.
        </p>
        <p>
          The OS and file system use system memory to speed up operations for
          all system processes. Failing to leave enough free system memory for
          this purpose will have an adverse effect on system performance due to
          OS swapping, and can even result in RabbitMQ process termination.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few recommendations when adjusting the default
          <code>vm_memory_high_watermark</code>:

          <ul class="plain">
            <li>
              Nodes hosting RabbitMQ should have at least <strong>128MB</strong> of
              memory available at all times.
            </li>
            <li>
              The recommended <code>vm_memory_high_watermark</code> range is
              <code>0.40 to 0.66</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Values above <code>0.7</code> are not recommended. The OS and
              file system must be left with at least 30% of the memory,
              otherwise performance may degrade severely due to paging.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          As with every tuning, benchmarking and measuring are required to find
          the best setting for your environment and workload.

      <doc:subsection name="resource-limits-disk-space">
        <doc:heading>Disk Space</doc:heading>
        <p>
          The current 50MB <code>disk_free_limit</code> default works very well for
          development and <a href="/getstarted.html">tutorials</a>.
          Production deployments require a much greater safety margin.
          Insufficient disk space will lead to node failures and may result in data loss
          as all disk writes will fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is the default 50MB then? Development
          environments sometimes use really small partitions to host
          <code>/var/lib</code>, for example, which means nodes go
          into resource alarm state right after booting. The very low
          default ensures that RabbitMQ works out of the box for
          everyone. As for production deployments, we recommend the
          following:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul class="plain">
            <li>
              <code>{disk_free_limit, {mem_relative, 1.0}}</code> is the
              minimum recommended value and it translates to the total amount of
              memory available. For example, on a host dedicated to
              RabbitMQ with 4GB of system memory, if available disk space drops
              below 4GB, all publishers will be blocked and no new messages
              will be accepted. Queues will need to be drained, normally by
              consumers, before publishing will be allowed to resume.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>{disk_free_limit, {mem_relative, 1.5}}</code> is a
              safer production value. On a RabbitMQ node with 4GB of
              memory, if available disk space drops below 6GB, all new messages
              will be blocked until the disk alarm clears. If RabbitMQ needs to
              flush to disk 4GB worth of data, as can sometimes be the case during
              shutdown, there will be sufficient disk space available for RabbitMQ
              to start again. In this specific example, RabbitMQ will start and
              immediately block all publishers since 2GB is well under the required
              6GB.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>{disk_free_limit, {mem_relative, 2.0}}</code> is the
              most conservative production value, we cannot think of any reason to use
              anything higher.If you want full confidence in RabbitMQ having
              all the disk space that it needs, at all times, this is the value
              to use.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>

      <doc:subsection name="resource-limits-file-handle-limit">
        <doc:heading>Open File Handles Limit</doc:heading>
        <p>
          Operating systems limit maximum number of concurrently open file handles, which
          includes network sockets. Make sure that you have limits set high enough to allow
          for expected number of concurrent connections and queues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure your environment allows for at least 50K open file descriptors for effective RabbitMQ
          user, including in development environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a rule of thumb, multiple the 95th percentile number of concurrent connections
          by 2 and add total number of queues to calculate recommended open file handle limit.
          Values as high as 500K are not inadequate and
          won't consume a lot of hardware resources, and therefore are recommended for production
          setups.

          <a href="/monitoring.html">Monitoring</a> several aspects of the system, from
          infrastructure and kernel metrics to RabbitMQ to application-level metrics is highly recommended.

      <doc:subsection name="security-considerations-tls">
        <doc:heading>TLS</doc:heading>
        <p>
          We recommend using <a href="/ssl.html">TLS connections</a> when possible,
          at least to encrypt traffic. Peer verification (authentication) is also recommended.
          Development and QA environments can use <a href="https://github.com/michaelklishin/tls-gen/">self-signed TLS certificates</a>.
          Self-signed certificates can be appropriate in production environments when
          RabbitMQ and all applications run on a trusted network or isolated using technologies
          such as VMware NSX.
        </p>
        <p>
          While RabbitMQ tries to offer a secure TLS configuration by
          default (e.g. SSLv3 is disabled), we recommend evaluating
          what TLS versions and cipher suites are enabled.  Please see
          our <a href="/ssl.html">TLS guide</a> for more information.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that TLS can have significant impact on overall system throughput,
          including CPU usage of both RabbitMQ and applications that use it.

          href="/dotnet-api-guide.html">.NET</a>, and <a href="http://rubybunny.info">Ruby</a> ones, support
          automatic connection recovery after network failures. If the

      <doc:heading>Clustering Considerations</doc:heading>

      <doc:subsection name="distribution-considerations-cluster-size">
        <doc:heading>Cluster Size</doc:heading>
        <p>
          When determining cluster size, it is important to take several factors into
          consideration:

          <ul>
            <li>Expected throughput</li>
            <li>Expected replication (number of mirrors)</li>
            <li>Data locality</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since clients can connect to any node, RabbitMQ may need to perform inter-cluster
          routing of messages and internal operations. Try making consumers and producers
          connect to the same node, if possible: this will reduce inter-node traffic.
          Equally helpful would be making consumers connect to the node that currently hosts
          queue master (can be inferred using <a href="/management.html">HTTP API</a>).
          When data locality is taken into consideration, total cluster throughput
          can reach <a href="http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/products/rabbitmq-hits-one-million-messages-per-second-on-google-compute-engine">non-trivial</a> volumes.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most environments, mirroring to more than half of cluster nodes is sufficient.
          It is recommended to use clusters with an odd number of nodes (3, 5, and so on).

        <doc:heading>Node Time Synchronization</doc:heading>
        <p>
            A RabbitMQ cluster will typically function well without clocks
            of participating servers being synchronized. However some plugins,
            such as the Management UI, make use of local timestamps for metrics
            processing and may display incorrect statistics when the current
            time of nodes drift apart. It is therefore recommended that servers
            use NTP or similar to ensure clocks remain in sync.

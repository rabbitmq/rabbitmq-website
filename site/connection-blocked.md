# Blocked Connection Notifications

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

It is sometimes desirable for clients to receive a notification
when their connection gets [blocked](/alarms.html)
due to the broker running low on resources (memory or disk).

We have introduced an AMQP 0-9-1 protocol extension in which the
broker sends to the client a `connection.blocked`
method when the connection gets blocked, and `connection.unblocked` when it is unblocked.

To receive these notifications, the client must present a
`capabilities` table in its `client-properties` in which there is a key
`connection.blocked` and a boolean value `true`.

See the [capabilities](/consumer-cancel.html#capabilities) section for further
details on this. Our supported clients indicate this capability
by default and provide a way to register handlers for the
`connection.blocked` and `connection.unblocked` methods.


## <a id="notifications" class="anchor" href="#notifications">When Notifications are Sent</a>

A `connection.blocked` notification is sent to
publishing connections the first time RabbitMQ is low on a
resource. For example, when a RabbitMQ node detects that it
is low on RAM, it sends
`connection.blocked` to all connected publishing
clients supporting this feature. If before the connections
are unblocked the node also starts running low on disk space,
another `connection.blocked` will not be sent.

A `connection.unblocked` is sent when **all**
resource alarms have cleared and the connection is fully
unblocked.


## <a id="java" class="anchor" href="#java">Using Blocked Connection Notifications with Java Client</a>

With the [official Java client](/api-guide.html), blocked connection
notifications are handled by `BlockedListener`
interface implementations. They can be registered on a
`Connection` using the
`Connection.addBlockedListener` method:

<pre class="lang-java">
ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
connection.addBlockedListener(new BlockedListener() {
    public void handleBlocked(String reason) throws IOException {
        // Connection is now blocked
    }

    public void handleUnblocked() throws IOException {
        // Connection is now unblocked
    }
});
</pre>


## <a id="dotnet" class="anchor" href="#dotnet">Using Blocked Connection Notifications with .NET Client</a>

With the [official .NET client](/dotnet-api-guide.html), blocked connection
notifications are handled by the
`RabbitMQ.Client.Events.ConnectionBlockedEventHandler`
delegate. `IConnection` provides
`IConnection.ConnectionBlocked` and
`IConnection.ConnectionUnblocked` events:

<pre class="lang-csharp">
  public void HandleBlocked(object sender, ConnectionBlockedEventArgs args)
  {
      // Connection is now blocked
  }

  public void HandleUnblocked(object sender, EventArgs args)
  {
      // Connection is now unblocked
  }

Conn.ConnectionBlocked   += HandleBlocked;
Conn.ConnectionUnblocked += HandleUnblocked;
</pre>

    <title>Firehose Tracer</title>

  <body>
      <doc:section>
	<p>
	  Sometimes, during development or debugging, it's useful to
	  be able to see every message that is published, and every
	  message that is delivered. RabbitMQ has a "firehose"
	  feature, where the administrator can enable (on a per-node,
	  per-vhost basis) an exchange to which publish- and
	  delivery-notifications should be CCed.
	</p>
        <p>
          These notifications are close to what's happening on the
          wire - for example you will see unacked messages.
        </p>
	<p>
	  When the feature is switched off, it has no effect on
	  performance; when it is switched on, performance will drop
	  somewhat due to additional messages being generated and
	  routed.
	</p>

	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      Decide which node, and which vhost, you want to enable
	      it for. In the examples below, we assume the default
	      vhost, "<code>/</code>", and the default node
	      "<code>rabbit@(hostname)</code>". Use the
	      <code>-n</code> argument to specify a node other than,
	      and the <code>-p</code> argument to specify another
	      vhost.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Within your chosen vhost create queues, bind them to the
	      topic exchange <code>amq.rabbitmq.trace</code>, and
	      begin consuming.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Run <code>rabbitmqctl trace_on</code>.
            </li>
	  </ol>
        </doc:subsection>
        <doc:subsection>
	  <doc:heading>Disabling the firehose</doc:heading>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      Run <code>rabbitmqctl trace_off</code>.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Clean up the queues used by the firehose.
	    </li>
	  </ol>
          <p>
            Note that the firehose state is not persistent; it will
            default of off at server start time.
          </p>

	      "<code>publish.<i>exchangename</i></code>", for messages

	      leaving the broker;

          The <code>rabbitmq_tracing</code> <a
          href="plugins.html">plugin</a> builds on top of the tracer
          and provides a GUI to capture traced messages and log them

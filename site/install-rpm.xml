    <p>
      <code>rabbitmq-server</code> is included in Fedora. However,
      the versions included are often quite old. You will probably
      get better results installing the .rpm from our website. Check
      the <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/rabbitmq-server">Fedora
        package</a> details for which version of the server is
      available for which versions of the distribution.
    </p>

    <h3>Install the Server</h3>

    <p>
      We strongly recommend using a packaged version of Erlang to run
      the server. This is part of Fedora, and
      in <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">EPEL</a> for
      RHEL. To enable EPEL on your Red Hat machine, see
      the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#howtouse">EPEL
        FAQ</a>. Then just <code>yum install erlang</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Erlang on RHEL 5 (and CentOS 5)</h3>

    <p>
      Due
      to <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/GuidelinesAndPolicies">
      the EPEL package update policy</a>, EPEL 5 contains Erlang
      version R12B-5, which is relatively old. rabbitmq-server
      supports R12B-5, but performance may be lower than for more
      recent Erlang versions, and certain non-core features are not
      supported (SSL support, HTTP-based plugins including
      the <a href="management.html">management
      plugin</a>). <b>Therefore, we recommend that you install the
      most recent stable version of Erlang.</b> The easiest way to do
      this is to use a package repository provided for this purpose by
      the owner of the EPEL Erlang package. Enable it by invoking (as
      root):
    </p>

    <pre>wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-erlang.repo http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/peter/erlang/epel-erlang.repo</pre>

    <p>
      and then install or update erlang with <code>yum install
        erlang</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Run RabbitMQ Server</h3>
    <dl class="instructions">
      <dt>Customise RabbitMQ Environment Variables</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The server should start using defaults. You can
          <a href="configure.html#customise-general-unix-environment">customise the RabbitMQ environment</a>.
          Also see how to <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">configure components</a>.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Start the Server</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The server is not started as a daemon by default when the
          RabbitMQ server package is installed. To start the daemon by default
          when the system boots, as an administrator run
          <code>chkconfig rabbitmq-server on</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an administrator, start and stop the
          server as usual using <code>/sbin/service rabbitmq-server
            <i>stop/start/etc</i></code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Note: </em>The server is set up to run as system user
          <code>rabbitmq</code>.
          If you change the location of the Mnesia database or the logs,
          you must ensure the files are owned by this user
          (and also update the environment variables).

    <p>
      <code>rabbitmq-server</code> is included in Fedora. However,
      the versions included are often quite old. You will probably
      get better results installing the .rpm from our website. Check
      the <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/rabbitmq-server">Fedora
      package</a> details for which version of the server is
      available for which versions of the distribution.
    </p>

    <h3>Install the Server</h3>
    <p>
      If you are on RHEL, or a derived distribution such as Fedora or
      CentOS, we strongly recommend using a packaged version of Erlang.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note: the steps you need to take vary, depending on which version of
      RHEL you are on.</strong>
    </p>
    <ol class="plain">
      <li>Enable <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">EPEL</a> (all versions)<br/>
        <p>
          Follow the steps in the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#howtouse">EPEL
          FAQ</a> to enable EPEL on your machine.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Enable Erlang repository (RHEL 5 and derived, including Fedora 6 and CentOS 5)<br/>
        <p>
          <strong>If you are on a later version of RHEL (or derived) you should skip this step.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/GuidelinesAndPolicies">
          the EPEL package update policy</a>, EPEL 5 contains a relatively
          old version of Erlang, R12B-5. Although <code>rabbitmq-server</code>
          supports R12B-5, performance may be lower than for more
          recent Erlang versions and certain non-core features are unsupported,
          such as SSL and HTTP-based plugins including
          the <a href="management.html">management plugin</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To install a more recent version of Erlang you need to enable a more
          up-to-date package repository that is provided by the owner of the
          Erlang package. To do this, issue the following command as 'root':
        </p>
        <pre>wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-erlang.repo http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/peter/erlang/epel-erlang.repo</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Install (or update) Erlang (all versions)<br/>
        <p>
          Issue the following command as 'root':
        </p>
        <pre>yum install erlang</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Install <code>rabbitmq-server</code> (all versions)<br/>
        <p>
          After downloading the server package, issue the following command as 'root':
        </p>
        <pre>yum install rabbitmq-server-&version-server;-&serverRPMMinorVersion;.noarch.rpm</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Potential Issues</h4>
    <p>
      Some common pitfalls that have been encountered and their solutions are
      listed below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Missing Dependency: libSDL-1.2.so.0()(64bit) is needed by package
        wxGTK-2.8.12-1.el5.x86_64 (epel)</em><br/>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Locate and install the 64bit SDL package
          for your platform, which will be named something like
          <code>SDL-1.2.*.x86-64.rpm</code>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em> Missing Dependency: libodbc.so.1()(64bit) is needed by package
        erlang-odbc-R14B-03.3.el5.x86_64 (epel-erlang)</em><br/>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Locate and install the 64bit unixODBC
          package for your platform, which will be named something like
          <code>unixODBC-2.2.*.x86-64.rpm</code>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Run RabbitMQ Server</h3>
    <dl class="instructions">
      <dt>Customise RabbitMQ Environment Variables</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The server should start using defaults. You can
          <a href="configure.html#customise-general-unix-environment">customise the RabbitMQ environment</a>.
          Also see how to <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">configure components</a>.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Start the Server</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The server is not started as a daemon by default when the
          RabbitMQ server package is installed. To start the daemon by default
          when the system boots, as an administrator run
          <code>chkconfig rabbitmq-server on</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an administrator, start and stop the
          server as usual using <code>/sbin/service rabbitmq-server
            <i>stop/start/etc</i></code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Note: </em>The server is set up to run as system user
          <code>rabbitmq</code>.
          If you change the location of the Mnesia database or the logs,
          you must ensure the files are owned by this user
          (and also update the environment variables).

          <strong>PURPOSE.</strong> Pivotal Software, Inc. (“Pivotal”) owns a number of
          international trademarks and logos that identify the RabbitMQ community
          and individual RabbitMQ projects (“RabbitMQ Marks”). These trademarks
          include:
        </p>
        <ol class="alpha">
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Word: RABBITMQ</strong>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

        <p>
          This policy outlines Pivotal’s policy and guidelines about the use of
          the RabbitMQ trademarks by members of the RabbitMQ development and
          user community.

          <strong>
            WHY HAVE TRADEMARK GUIDELINES?
          </strong> The RabbitMQ Marks are a symbol of the
          quality and community support associated with the RabbitMQ open
          source software. Trademarks protect not only those using the marks,
          but the entire community as well. Our community members need to know
          that they can rely on the quality and capabilities represented by the
          brand. We also want to provide a level playing field. No one should
          use the RabbitMQ marks in ways that mislead or take advantage of the
          community, or make unfair use of the trademarks. Also, use of the
          RabbitMQ Marks should not be in a disparaging manner because we
          prefer that our marks not be used to be rude about the RabbitMQ open
          source project or its members.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            OPEN SOURCE LICENSE VS. TRADEMARKS.
          </strong> The Apache 2.0 license gives you
          the right to use, copy, distribute and modify the RabbitMQ software.
          However, open source licenses like the Apache 2.0 license do not
          address trademarks. RabbitMQ Marks need to be used in a way
          consistent with trademark law, and that is why we have prepared this
          policy – to help you understand what branding is allowed or required
          when using our software under the Apache license.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            PROPER USE OF THE RabbitMQ MARKS.
          </strong> We want to encourage a robust
          community for the RabbitMQ open source project. Therefore, you may do
          any of the following, as long as you do so in a way that does not
          devalue, dilute, or disparage the RabbitMQ brand. In other words,
          when you do these things, you should behave responsibly and
          reasonably in the interest of the community, but you do not need a
          trademark license from us to do them.
        </p>

              <strong>
                Nominative Use.
              </strong> You may engage in “nominative use” of the
              RabbitMQ name, but this does not allow you to use the logo.
              Nominative use is sometimes called “fair use” of a trademark, and
              does not require a trademark license from us.  Here are examples:
            </p>
            <ol class="roman">
              <li>
                <p>
                  You may use the RabbitMQ Marks in connection with development
                  of tools, add-ons, or utilities that are compatible with
                  bit-for-bit identical copies of official RabbitMQ software.
                  For example:  For example, if you are developing a Foobar
                  tool for RabbitMQ, acceptable project titles would be “Foobar
                  for RabbitMQ".
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  You may use the RabbitMQ Marks in connection with your
                  noncommercial redistribution of (1) bit-for-bit identical
                  copies of official RabbitMQ software, and (2) unmodified
                  copies of official RabbitMQ source packages.  For example, if
                  your Foobar product included a full redistribution of
                  official RabbitMQ Software or source code packages:
                  "RabbitMQ-powered Foobar Product". We strongly discourage,
                  and likely would consider it a trademark problem, to use a
                  name such as “RabbitMQ Foobar.”
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If you offer maintenance, support, or hosting services for
                  RabbitMQ software, you may accurately state that in your
                  marketing materials or portfolio, without using the RabbitMQ
                  logo.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  You may modify the RabbitMQ software and state that your
                  modified software is “based on the RabbitMQ software” or a
                  similar accurate statement, without using the RabbitMQ logo.

              <li>
                <p>
                  You may engage in community advocacy. The RabbitMQ software
                  is developed by and for its community. We will allow the use
                  of the word trademark in this context, provided:

                      discussions for those groups.  Please consider joining

                Redistribution of Binaries.
              </strong> If you redistribute binaries that you have downloaded
              from the RabbitMQ repository, you should retain the logos and
              name of the product.  However, if you make any changes to the
              binaries (other than configuration or installation changes that
              do not involve changes to the source code), or if you re-build
              binaries from our source code, you should not use our logos.  Our
              logos represent our quality control, so they should be retained
              where the product has been built by us, but not otherwise.  Our
              source code does not include logo image files, to remind you to
              follow this rule.

              trademark, or implies any foundational or authorship role. If you
              have a software product that works with RabbitMQ, it is suggested
              you use terms such as ‘&lt;product name> for RabbitMQ’ or
              ‘&lt;product name>, RabbitMQ Edition.” If you wish to form an

              software, unless the combined distribution is an official
              RabbitMQ distribution. For example, you may not distribute a

              </strong> You must not use RabbitMQ or any confusingly
              similar phrase in a domain name. For instance
              “www.rabbitmqhost.com” is not allowed. If you wish to use such a

              glad to discuss a license for a suitable domain name.  Because of
              the many persons who, unfortunately, seek to spoof, swindle or
              deceive the community by using confusing domain names, we must be
              very strict about this rule.

          trademarks (for example, RABBITMQ®). When you use a RabbitMQ
          trademark you should include a statement attributing the trademark to
          Pivotal. For example, "RabbitMQ is a trademark of Pivotal Software,
          Inc. in the U.S. and other countries."

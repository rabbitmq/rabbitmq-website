    <title>Lazy Queues</title>

  <body>
    <doc:section name="overview">
      <p>
        Since <strong>RabbitMQ 3.6.0</strong> the broker has the
        concept of <em>Lazy Queues</em>: these are queues that try to
        keep as many messages as possible on disk, and only load them
        in RAM when requested by consumers, therefore the lazy
        denomination.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the main goals of lazy queues is to be able to support
        very long queues (many millions of messages). These queues can
        arise when consumers are unable to fetch messages from queues
        for long periods of times. This can happen for various reasons
        and use cases: because consumers are offline; because they
        have crashed, or they have been taken down for maintenance;
        and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        By default, queues keep an in-memory cache of messages that's
        filled up as messages are published into RabbitMQ. The idea of
        this cache is to be able to deliver messages to consumers as
        fast as possible (note that persistent messages are written to
        disk as they enter the broker <i>and</i> kept in this cache at
        the same time). Whenever the broker considers it needs to free
        up memory, messages from this cache will be paged out to
        disk. Paging messages to disk takes time and block the queue
        process, making it unable to receive new messages while it's
        paging. Even if on recent RabbitMQ versions we have improved
        the paging algorithm, the situation is still not ideal for use
        cases where you have many millions on messages in the queue
        that might need to be paged out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lazy queues help here by eliminating this cache and only
        loading messages in memory when requested by consumers. Lazy
        queues will send every message that arrives to the queue right
        away to the file system, completely eliminating the in-memory
        cache mentioned before. This has the consequence of heavily
        reducing the amount of RAM consumed by a queue and also
        eliminates the need for paging. While this will increase I/O
        usage, it is the same behaviour as when publishing persistent
        messages.

      <doc:heading>Using Lazy Queues</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Queues can be made to work in <code>default</code> mode or
        <code>lazy</code> mode either by specifying the mode via
        <code>queue.declare</code> arguments, or by applying a <a
        href="parameters.html#policies">policy</a> in the server. In
        the case where both policy and queue arguments specify a queue
        mode, then the queue argument has priority over the policy
        value. This means that if a queue mode is set via a declare
        argument, it can only be changed by deleting the queue, and
        re-declaring it later with a different argument.
      </p>

      <h3>Configuration using arguments</h3>
      <p>
        The queue mode can be set by supplying the
        <code>x-queue-mode</code> queue declaration argument with a
        string specifying the desired mode. Valid modes are
        <code>"default"</code> and <code>"lazy"</code>. If no mode is
        specified during declare, then <code>"default"</code> is
        assumed. The <code>default</code> mode is the behaviour
        already present in pre 3.6.0 versions of the broker, so there
        are no breaking changes in this regard.
      </p>

      <p>
        This example in Java declares a queue with the queue mode set
        to <code>"lazy"</code>:
      </p>
      <pre class="sourcecode">
        Map&lt;String, Object> args = new HashMap&lt;String, Object>();
        args.put("x-queue-mode", "lazy");
        channel.queueDeclare("myqueue", false, false, false, args);
      </pre>

      <h3>Configuration using policy</h3>

      <p>
        To specify a queue mode using a policy, add the key
        <code>queue-length</code> to a policy definition. For example:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>rabbitmqctl</th>
          <td>
            <pre>rabbitmqctl set_policy Lazy "^lazy-queue$" '{"queue-mode":"lazy"}' --apply-to queues</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>rabbitmqctl (Windows)</th>
          <td>
            <pre>rabbitmqctl set_policy Lazy "^lazy-queue$" "{""queue-mode"":""lazy""}" --apply-to queues</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        This ensures the queue called <code>lazy-queue</code> will
        work in the <code>lazy</code> mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        Policies can also be defined using the management plugin, see
        the <a href="parameters.html#policies">policy
        documentation</a> for more details.
      </p>

      <h3>Changing queue modes</h3>
      <p>
        If you specified the queue mode via a policy, then you can
        change it at run time without the need of deleting the queue
        and re-declaring it with a different mode. If you want the
        previous <code>lazy-queue</code> to start working like a
        <code>default</code> queue, then you can do so by issuing the
        following command:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>rabbitmqctl</th>
          <td>
            <pre>rabbitmqctl set_policy Lazy "^lazy-queue$" '{"queue-mode":"default"}' --apply-to queues</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>rabbitmqctl (Windows)</th>
          <td>
            <pre>rabbitmqctl set_policy Lazy "^lazy-queue$" "{""queue-mode"":""default""}" --apply-to queues</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section>
      <doc:heading>Performance Considerations for Lazy Queues</doc:heading>

      <h3>Disk Utilization</h3>
      <p>
        As stated above, lazy queues will send every message to disk
        right as they enter the queue. This will increase I/O opts,
        but keep in mind that this is the same behaviour as when
        persistent messages are delivered to queues. Note that even if
        you publish <em>transient</em> messages, they will still be
        sent to disk when using <code>lazy</code> queues. With
        <code>default</code> queues <em>transient</em> messages are
        only sent to disk if paging requires it.
      </p>

      <h3>RAM Utilization</h3>
      <p>
        <code>lazy</code queues use much less memory than
        <code>default</code> queues. While it's hard to give numbers,
        since every use case is different, we tried publishing 10
        million messages into a queue; with no consumers online. The
        message body size was 1000 bytes. <code>default</code> queues
        required 1.2GB of RAM, while <code>lazy</code> queues only
        used 1.5MB of RAM.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a <code>default</code> queue, it took 801 seconds to send
        10MM messages, with an average sending rate of 12469 msg/s. To
        publish the same amount of messages into a <code>lazy</code>
        queue, the time required was 421 seconds, with an average
        sending rate of 23653 msg/s. The difference can be explained
        by the fact that from time to time, the <code>default</code>
        queue had to page messages to disk.
      </p>

      <p>You can reproduce the test with our <a
        href="java-tools.html">Java library</a> by running:
      </p>

      <pre>
        ./runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.PerfTest -e test -u test_queue -f persistent -s 1000 -x1 -y0 -C10000000
      </pre>

      <p>
        <bold>Note that this was a very simplistic test. Please make
        sure to run your own benchmarks.</bold>
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't forget to change the queue mode between benchmarks runs.
      </p>

      <h3>Converting between queue modes</h3>
      <p>
        If we need to convert a <code>default</code> queue into a
        <code>lazy</code> one, then we will suffer the same
        performance impact as when a queue needs to page messages to
        disk. When we convert a queue into a <code>lazy</code> one,
        first it will page messages to disk and then it will start
        accepting publishes, acks, and other commands.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a queue goes from the <code>lazy</code> mode to the
        <code>default</code> one, it will perform the same process as
        when a queue is recovered after a server restart. A batch of
        16384 messages will be loaded in the cache mentioned above.

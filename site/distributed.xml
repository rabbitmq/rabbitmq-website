    <title>Distributed RabbitMQ brokers</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="intro">
      AMQP and the other messaging protocols supported by RabbitMQ via
      plug-ins (e.g. STOMP), are (of course) inherently distributed -
      it is quite common for applications from multiple machines to
      connect to a single broker, even across the internet.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
      Sometimes however it is necessary or desirable to make the
      RabbitMQ broker itself distributed. There are three ways in
      which to accomplish that: with clustering, with federation, and
      using the shovel. This page explains the purpose of each
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that you do not need to pick a single approach - you can
      connect clusters together with federation, or the shovel, or both.
    </p>

    <h2>Clustering</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="clustering.html">Clustering</a> connects multiple
      machines together to form a single logical broker. Communication
      is via Erlang message-passing, so all nodes in the cluster must
      have the same Erlang cookie. The network links between machines
      in a cluster <b>must</b> be reliable, and all machines in the
      cluster must run the same versions of RabbitMQ and Erlang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virtual hosts, exchanges, users, and permissions are
      automatically mirrored across all nodes in a cluster. Queues may
      be located on a single node, or <a href="ha.html">mirrored
      across multiple nodes</a>. A client connecting to any node in a
      cluster can see all queues in the cluster, even if they are not
      located on that node.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically you would use clustering for high availability and
      increased throughput, with machines in a single location.
    </p>

    <h2>Federation</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="federation.html">Federation</a> allows an exchange or
      queue on one broker to receive messages published to an exchange
      or queue on another (the brokers may be individual machines, or
      clusters). Communication is via AMQP (with optional SSL), so for
      two exchanges or queues to federate they must be granted
      appropriate users and permissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Federated exchanges are connected with one way point-to-point
      links. By default, messages will only be forwarded over a
      federation link once, but this can be increased to allow for
      more complex routing topologies. Some messages may not be
      forwarded over the link; if a message would not be routed to a
      queue after reaching the federated exchange, it will not be
      forwarded in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Federated queues are similarly connected with one way
      point-to-point links. Messages will be moved between federated
      queues an arbitrary number of times to follow the consumers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically you would use federation to link brokers across the
      internet for pub/sub messaging and work queueing.
    </p>

    <h2>The Shovel</h2>
    <p>
      Connecting brokers
      with <a href="shovel.html">the
      shovel</a> is conceptually similar to connecting them with
      federation. However, the shovel works at a lower level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas federation aims to provide opinionated distribution of
      exchanges and queues, the shovel simply consumes messages from a
      queue on one broker, and forwards them to an exchange on
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically you would use the shovel to link brokers across the
      internet when you need more control than federation provides.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="shovel-dynamic.html">Dynamic shovels</a> can also be
      useful for moving messages around in an ad-hoc manner on a
      single broker.
    </p>

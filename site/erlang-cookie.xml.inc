  <doc:heading>Erlang cookie</doc:heading>
  <p>
    Erlang nodes use a cookie to determine whether they are
    allowed to communicate with each other - for two nodes to
    be able to communicate they must have the same cookie.
    The cookie is just a string of alphanumeric characters. It
    can be as long or short as you like.
  </p>
  <p>
    Erlang will automatically create a random cookie file when
    the RabbitMQ server starts up. The easiest way to proceed is to allow
    one node to create the file, and then copy it to all the
    other nodes in the cluster.
  </p>
  <p>
    On Unix systems, the cookie will be typically
    located in <code>/var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie</code>
    or <code>$HOME/.erlang.cookie</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    On Windows, the locations are <code>C:\Users\<i>Current User</i>\.erlang.cookie</code> (<code>%HOMEDRIVE% + %HOMEPATH%\.erlang.cookie</code>)
    or <code>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>Current User</i>\.erlang.cookie</code>, and
    <code>C:\Windows\.erlang.cookie</code> for RabbitMQ Windows service.
    If Windows service is used, the cookie should be placed in both places.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an alternative, you can insert the option "<code>-setcookie
    <i>cookie</i></code>" in the <code>erl</code> call in the
    <code>rabbitmq-server</code> and <code>rabbitmqctl</code>
    scripts.

    <p>
      The routing logic in AMQP does not offer a way for message
      publishers to select intended recipients. This is the
      equivalent of entering multiple recipients in the "CC"
      field of an email. The RabbitMQ broker treats two headers
      in a special way to overcome this limitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The values associated with the "CC" and "BCC" header keys will
      be added to the routing key if they are present. The message
      will be routed to all destinations matching the routing key
      supplied as a parameter to the <code>basic.publish</code>
      method, as well as the routes supplied in the "CC" and "BCC"
      headers. The type of "CC" and "BCC" values must be an array
      of <a href="/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#domain.longstr">longstr</a>
      and these keys are case-sensitive. If the header does not
      contain "CC" or "BCC" keys then this extension has no effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "BCC" key and value will be removed from the message
      prior to delivery, offering some confidentiality among
      consumers. This feature is a violation of the AMQP
      specification which forbids any message modification,
      including headers. This feature imposes a small
      performance penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This extension is independent of the client. Any AMQP
      client with the ability to interoperate with RabbitMQ and
      set header values can make use of this extension.

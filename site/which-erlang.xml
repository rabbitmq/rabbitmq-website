    <title>Erlang Versions</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3>Which Version of Erlang?</h3>
    <p>
      In general, use the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download.html">latest available</a>
      stable (non-alpha) version of Erlang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minimum version of <a href="http://www.erlang.org">Erlang</a>
      required to run the RabbitMQ server is <strong>R16B03</strong>.
      If you absolutely must use an older version of Erlang, RabbitMQ
      3.5.x is the newest version compatible with R13B03.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain RabbitMQ configurations require more recent versions:
    </p>
    <table>
      <th>If you want to:</th><th>Minimum version</th><th>Notes</th>
      <tr>
        <td>build / run <a href="download.html">RabbitMQ</a> server and most plugins</td>
        <td>R16B03</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>use <a href="ssl.html">SSL/TLS</a> reliably</td>
        <td>17.0</td>
        <td>Covers most common signature algorithms and can honor server ciphers order.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      If using <a href="clustering.html#upgrading">clustered</a> nodes,
      all nodes should use the same version of Erlang.
    </p>

    <h3>OS support</h3>
    <p>
      Most current distributions now package Erlang that supports all
      the above. One (partial) exception is Red Hat Enterprise Linux -
      RPMs are available but not as part of the core distribution.
      See the <a href="install-rpm.html">RPM-based Linux
      Installation</a> page for how to install Erlang on RPM-based
      distributions.
    </p>

    <h3>Building Erlang from source</h3>
    <p>
      If a sufficiently recent Erlang package is not available for your system then you will need to
      <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/installation_guide/INSTALL.html">build Erlang from source</a>.
      This requires a build environment that satisfies the Erlang build dependencies, such as OpenSSL.

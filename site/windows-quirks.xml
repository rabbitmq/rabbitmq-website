    <title>Windows Quirks</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      We aim to make RabbitMQ a first-class citizen on
      Windows. However, sometimes there are circumstances beyond our
      control that can introduce quirky behaviour. This page documents
      them.
    </p>

    <h3>Cannot install to a path with non-ASCII characters</h3>
    <p>
      RabbitMQ will fail to start with the error "<code>RabbitMQ: Erlang machine stopped instantly (distribution name conflict?)</code>"
      when installed to a path with
      non-ASCII characters in it. This is because we need to pass the
      location of the compiled Erlang files to the Erlang VM. It
      expects input in UTF-8, but the console will typically use some
      other encoding.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Workarounds:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Override <code>RABBITMQ_BASE</code> to point to a directory
        that only has ASCII characters and <em>re-install</em> the
        service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Edit the file <code>rabbitmq-server.bat</code> and change the
        line "<code>set TDP0=%~dp0</code>" to "<code>set
        TDP0=%~dps0</code>". This will use short paths (the
        infamous <code>C:\PROGRA~1</code>) everywhere.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>rabbitmqctl shows / parses non-ASCII characters incorrectly</h3>
    <p>
      Similarly, <code>rabbitmqctl</code> will expect command line
      parameters to be encoded in UTF-8, and display strings as
      UTF-8. The console will instead provide and expect some
      country-specific encoding.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Workarounds:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        On recent versions of Windows, issue the command "<code>chcp
        65001</code>" before using <code>rabbitmqctl</code> to force
        the console to use UTF-8. (Beware: on older versions
        including Windows XP this will cause the console to silently
        fail to run any batch file at all!) <em>or</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid using non-ASCII characters in object names <em>or</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the <a href="management.html">management plugin</a> instead of
        <code>rabbitmqctl</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Installing as a non-administrator user leaves .erlang.cookie
    in the wrong place</h3>
    <p>
      This makes it impossible to use <code>rabbitmqctl</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Workarounds:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Run the installer as an administrator <em>or</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Copy the file <code>.erlang.cookie</code> manually
        from <code>%SystemRoot%</code> to
        <code>%HOMEDRIVE%</code><code>%HOMEPATH%</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Shutting down Windows</h3>
    <p>
      It is necessary to take precautions when shutting down Windows
      and using versions of Erlang prior to R15B02. Due to limitations
      in older versions of the underlying Erlang VM, the broker will
      not go through a controlled shutdown sequence when Windows
      shuts down. If RabbitMQ is installed as a service using an older
      version of Erlang then you must stop the service manually before
      shutting down Windows. Failure to do so may cause the broker to
      spend longer on recovery when started subsequently. The use of
      Erlang R15B02 or later is recommended to avoid this problem.

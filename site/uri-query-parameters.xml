    <title>URI query parameters</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="intro">
      This page is a less-formal companion to the <a
      href="uri-spec.html">URI specification</a>, documenting how the
      officially-supported clients interpret URI parameters. Currently
      only the Erlang client does so.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="federation-reference.html#upstreams">federation</a>
      and <a href="shovel.html#uris">shovel</a> plugins specify
      connections to other brokers using URIs, and are implemented
      using the Erlang client, so they take all the parameters
      described here for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Query parameters are added to the URI in the usual way. Any
      parameter can be omitted. The client will pick sensible defaults
      when they are.
    </p>

    <p>
      Example:
    </p>

    <pre>amqp://myhost?heartbeat=10&amp;connection_timeout=10000</pre>

    <p>
      This specifies a (non-encrypted) network connection to the host
      <code>myhost</code>. The heartbeat interval is set to 5 seconds,
      and connection timeout is set to 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds). Other parameters are
      set to their default values.
    </p>

    <!--
         TODO when another client supports some of these, split them
         out into standardised and client-specific. For example,
         auth_mechanism and heartbeat seem fairly standard, but the
         SSL bits are quite tied to the Erlang SSL implementation.

    <p>
      <a href="/ssl.html">TLS options</a> can also be specified globally using the
      <code>amqp_client.ssl_options</code> configuration key. They will be merged with
      the TLS parameters from the URI (the latter will take
      precedence) and affect all outgoing RabbitMQ Erlang client connections
      on the node, including plugins that use the client internally (Federation, Shovel, etc).
      Please see the <a href="/ssl.html">TLS guide</a> for details.

    <title>URI query parameters</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="intro">
      This page is a less-formal companion to the <a
      href="uri-spec.html">URI specification</a>, documenting how the
      officially-supported clients interpret URI parameters. Currently
      only the Erlang client does so.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="federation-reference.html#upstreams">federation</a>
      and <a href="shovel.html#uris">shovel</a> plugins specify
      connections to other brokers using URIs, and are implemented
      using the Erlang client, so they take all the parameters
      described here for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Query parameters are added to the URI in the usual way. Any
      parameter can be omitted. The client will pick sensible defaults
      when they are.
    </p>

    <p>
      Example:
    </p>

    <pre>amqp://myhost?heartbeat=5&amp;frame_max=8192</pre>

    <p>
      This specifies a (non-encrypted) network connection to the host
      <code>myhost</code>. The heartbeat interval is set to 5 seconds,
      and the maximum frame size to 8192 bytes. Other parameters are
      set to their default values.
    </p>

    <!--
         TODO when another client supports some of these, split them
         out into standardised and client-specific. For example,
         auth_mechanism and heartbeat seem fairly standard, but the
         SSL bits are quite tied to the Erlang SSL implementation.

    <p>
      SSL options can also be specified globally using the
      <code>ssl_config</code> environment key for the
      <code>amqp_client</code> application. They will be merged with
      the SSL parameters from the URI (the latter will take
      precedence).

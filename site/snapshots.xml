    <title>Snapshots Releases</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="intro">
      RabbitMQ server builds that successfully went through our CI
      pipeline are published. These builds are available so that users
      can try out the latest features and bug fixes as soon as they
      become available.
    </p>

    <doc:section name="stability-and-safety">
      <doc:heading>Stability and Suitability of Snapshot Builds</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Snapshot builds are produced from all supported release series branches and from
        the 'master' branch which will become the next feature release.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of the 'master' branch, this represents the
        <i>bleeding edge</i> and therefore should not be considered
        complete (finished) or stable. It is quite possible that
        existing features, APIs and/or configuration data formats have
        been changed in ways that are not backwards compatible or even
        removed altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the changes described above, it is also possible that
        incompatible changes have been made to the way persistent storage
        is handled. Such changes may mean that after installing a snapshot,
        your RabbitMQ installation <i>cannot be rolled back to a
          previous (stable) version</i>. To avoid conflicting with the existing
        installation, you should either remove it first, or configure the
        snapshot installation to use an alternative location for its
        persistent storage and (potentially) other configuration elements
        using the <a href="relocate.html">provided instructions</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Snapshot releases therefore are suitable for development and some QA
        environments but not intended to be used in production.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="documentation">
      <h2>Documentation of the 'master' branch</h2>
      <p>
        Documentation for master branch of the broker is continuously published to
        <a href="http://next.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html">next.rabbitmq.com</a>.
        Note that master documentation can lag behind code changes, sometimes
        intentionally so.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="downloads">
      <doc:heading>Downloads and Installation</doc:heading>
      <p>
        As with our published live releases, we continue to digitally
        sign the snapshot artefacts using
        <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> and
        <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc">
          our release public signing key</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Direct Downloads</h3>
      <p>
        All snapshot artefacts, indexed by their version, are available
        in the <em>all-dev</em> repository on Bintray:
      </p>
      <ul class="plain">
        <li><a href="https://bintray.com/rabbitmq/all-dev/rabbitmq-server">Bintray webpage</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://dl.bintray.com/rabbitmq/all-dev/rabbitmq-server/">Bintray repository</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Debian repository</h3>
      <p>
        Packages for many Debian-based Linux distributions are available
        from a Bintray repository called <em>debian-dev</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use Debian components to select exactly what you want:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><tt>main</tt></dt>
        <dd>Gives access to all snapshots we produce, not only the RabbitMQ server.</dd>
        <dt><tt>rabbitmq</tt></dt>
        <dd>Gives access to all snapshots of the RabbitMQ server, no matter the branch.</dd>
        <dt><tt>rabbitmq-v3.6.x</tt></dt>
        <dd>Gives access to snapshots of the 3.6.x line of the RabbitMQ server.</dd>
        <dt><tt>rabbitmq-v3.7.x</tt></dt>
        <dd>Gives access to snapshots of the 3.7.x line of the RabbitMQ server.</dd>
      </dl>
      <ul class="plain">
        <li><a href="https://bintray.com/rabbitmq/debian-dev/rabbitmq-server">Bintray webpage</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://dl.bintray.com/rabbitmq/debian-dev/">Bintray repository</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For instance, if you want to use RabbitMQ 3.6.x snapshots on a Debian Wheezy:
        <pre class="sourcecode sh">
wget -O- https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc | apt-key add -
cat >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/rabbitmq-dev.list &lt;&lt;EOF
deb http://dl.bintray.com/rabbitmq/debian-dev wheezy rabbitmq-server-v3.6.x
EOF
apt-get update
apt-get install rabbitmq-server</pre>
      </p>
      <h3>Yum repository</h3>
      <p>
        Packages for RPM-based Linux distributions are available from a
        Bintray repository called <em>rpm-dev</em> which serves several
        Yum repositories. There is a Yum repository per package we
        produce (the RabbitMQ server being one) and per version of
        supported distributions.
      </p>
      <ul class="plain">
        <li><a href="https://bintray.com/rabbitmq/rpm-dev/rabbitmq-server">Bintray webpage</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://dl.bintray.com/rabbitmq/rpm-dev/rabbitmq-server/">Bintray repository</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For instance, if you want to use RabbitMQ 3.6.x snapshots on a CentOS 7:
        <pre class="sourcecode sh">
cat >/etc/yum.repos.d/rabbitmq-dev.repo &lt;&lt;EOF
[rabbitmq-dev]
name=rabbitmq-dev
baseurl=https://dl.bintray.com/rabbitmq/rpm-dev/rabbitmq-server/v3.6.x/el/7
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc
repo_gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
EOF
yum install rabbitmq-server</pre>
      </p>

      <doc:heading>Providing Feedback</doc:heading>

      <p>
        Team RabbitMQ appreciates community feedback on snapshot builds.
        Please post it to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users">RabbitMQ mailing list</a>

          <li><code>rabbitmqctl status</code> output</li>
          <li>OS and distribution version</li>
          <li>Erlang version used</li>
        </ul>

        and so on. Thank you!

OpenPGP Key Transition Statement for RabbitMQ (Nightly builds)

We have created a new OpenPGP key and will be transitioning away from
the old key. The old key has not been compromised and will continue
to be valid for some time, but we will sign release artifacts and
repositories with the new key going forward.

We would like this new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust.
This message is signed by both keys to certify the transition.  The new
and old keys are signed by each other.

The old key, which we are transitioning away from, is:

pub   dsa1024/0x0697F46E2DF405B6 2010-08-23 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = 9EFB 5FE2 CBEB 7999 23EE  0F58 0697 F46E 2DF4 05B6
uid                              RabbitMQ (Nightly builds) <info@rabbitmq.com>

The new key, to which we are transitioning, is:

pub   rsa4096/0xD441A9DDBA058EF7 2016-05-17 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = C77F 043E C632 A405 91D2  158B D441 A9DD BA05 8EF7
uid                              RabbitMQ Nightly Signing Key <info@rabbitmq.com>

The entire key may be downloaded from: https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-nightly-signing-key.asc

To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

  gpg --recv-key 0xD441A9DDBA058EF7

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 0xD441A9DDBA058EF7

If you'd like any further verification or have any questions about the
transition please contact us directly.

To verify the integrity of this statement:

  wget -q -O- https://www.rabbitmq.com/key-transition-0x0697F46E2DF405B6.txt | gpg --verify

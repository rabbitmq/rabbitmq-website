      <p>
        The high-level goal of the federation plugin is to transmit messages
        between brokers without requiring clustering. This is useful for a number of
        reasons.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Loose Coupling of Nodes or Clusters</h3>

        The federation plugin can transmit messages between brokers
        (or clusters) in different administrative domains:
        <ul class="plain">
          <li>
            they may have different users and virtual hosts;
          </li>
          <li>
            they may run on different versions of RabbitMQ and Erlang.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>WAN friendliness</h3>

        The federation plugin uses AMQP 0-9-1 to communicate between brokers, and is
        designed to tolerate intermittent connectivity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Specificity</h3>

        A broker can contain federated <i>and</i> local-only components - you
        don't need to federate everything if you don't want to.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Scalability with Growing Connected Node Count</h3>

        Federation does not require O(n<sup>2</sup>) connections between
        <i>n</i> brokers (although this is the easiest way to set
        things up), which should mean it scales better.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="what-does-it-do">
      <doc:heading>What Does It Do?</doc:heading>
      <p>
        The federation plugin allows you to make exchanges and queues
        <i>federated</i>. A federated exchange or queue can receive
        messages from one or more <i>upstreams</i> (remote exchanges
        and queues on other brokers). A federated exchange can route
        messages published upstream to a local queue. A federated
        queue lets a local consumer receive messages from an upstream
        queue.
      </p>

      <p>
        Federation links connect to upstreams using RabbitMQ Erlang client. Therefore
        they can connect to a specific vhost, use TLS, use multiple
        <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/authentication.html">authentication mechanisms</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For more details, see the
        documentation on <a href="federated-exchanges.html">federated
        exchanges</a> and <a href="federated-queues.html">federated
        queues</a>.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="how-is-it-configured">
      <doc:heading>How is Federation Set Up?</doc:heading>

      <p>
        To use federation, one needs to configure two things

        <ul>
          <li>
            One or more upstreams that define federation connections
            to other nodes. This can be done via <a href="/parameters.html">runtime parameters</a>
            or the <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation-management">federation management plugin</a> which
            adds a federation management tab to the <a href="/management.html">management UI</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            One or more policies that match exchanges/queues and makes them
            federated.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="getting-started">
      <doc:heading>Getting Started</doc:heading>

      <p>
        The federation plugin is included in the RabbitMQ distribution. To
        enable it, use
        <a href="man/rabbitmq-plugins.8.html">rabbitmq-plugins</a>:
      </p>
      <pre class="lang-bash">rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_federation</pre>

      <p>
        When using the management plugin, you will also want to
        enable <code>rabbitmq_federation_management</code>:
      </p>
      <pre class="lang-bash">rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_federation_management</pre>

      <p>
        When using a federation in a cluster, all the nodes of the
        cluster should have the federation plugin enabled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Information about federation upstreams is stored in the RabbitMQ
        database, along with users, permissions, queues, etc. There
        are three levels of configuration involved in federation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Upstreams</b>: each upstream defines how to connect
          to another broker.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Upstream sets</b>: each upstream set groups together a
          set of upstreams to use for federation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Policies</b>: each policy selects a set of exchanges,
          queues or both, and applies a single upstream or an upstream
          set to those objects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In practice, for simple use cases you can almost ignore the
        existence of upstream sets, since there is an
        implicitly-defined upstream set called <code>all</code> to
        which all upstreams are added.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upstreams and upstream sets are both instances of
        <a href="/parameters.html">runtime parameters</a>.  Like exchanges and queues, each virtual host
        has its own distinct set of parameters and policies. For more
        generic information on parameters and policies, see the
        documentation on <a href="/parameters.html">parameters and
        policies</a>. For full details on the parameters used by
        federation, see the <a href="federation-reference.html">federation
        reference</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Parameters and policies can be set in three ways - either with
        an invocation of <code>rabbitmqctl</code>, a call to the
        management HTTP API, or (usually) through the web UI presented
        by <code>rabbitmq_federation_management</code>. (The web UI
        does not present all possibilities - in particular, it does
        not allow you to manage upstream sets.)
      </p>

      <doc:subsection name="tutorial">
        <doc:heading>A simple example</doc:heading>

        <p>
          Here we will federate all the built-in exchanges except for
          the default exchange, with a single upstream. The upstream
          will be defined to buffer messages when disconnected for up
          to one hour (3600000ms).
        </p>

        <p><b>Define an upstream:</b></p>
        <table>
        <tr>
          <th>rabbitmqctl</th>
          <td>
            <code>rabbitmqctl set_parameter federation-upstream my-upstream \<br/>'{"uri":"amqp://server-name","expires":3600000}'</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>rabbitmqctl (Windows)</th>
          <td>
            <code>rabbitmqctl set_parameter federation-upstream my-upstream ^<br/>"{""uri"":""amqp://server-name"",""expires"":3600000}"</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>HTTP API</th>
          <td>
            PUT <code>/api/parameters/federation-upstream/%2f/my-upstream</code><br/>
            <code>{"value":{"uri":"amqp://server-name","expires":3600000}}</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Web UI</th>
          <td>
            Navigate to <code>Admin</code> > <code>Federation Upstreams</code> >
            <code>Add a new upstream</code>. Enter "my-upstream" next to Name,
            "amqp://server-name" next to URI, and 36000000 next to
            Expiry. Click Add upstream.
          </td>
        </tr>
        </table>

        <p><b>Then define a policy that will match built-in exchanges and use this upstream:</b></p>
        <table>
        <tr>
          <th>rabbitmqctl</th>
          <td>
            <code>rabbitmqctl set_policy --apply-to exchanges federate-me "^amq\." \<br/>'{"federation-upstream-set":"all"}'</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>rabbitmqctl (Windows)</th>
          <td>
            <code>rabbitmqctl set_policy --apply-to exchanges federate-me "^amq\." ^<br/>"{""federation-upstream-set"":""all""}"</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>HTTP API</th>
          <td>
            PUT <code>/api/policies/%2f/federate-me</code><br/>
            <code>{"pattern":"^amq\.", "definition":{"federation-upstream-set":"all"}, \<br/> "apply-to":"exchanges"}</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Web UI</th>
          <td>
            Navigate to Admin > Policies > Add / update a
            policy. Enter "federate-me" next to "Name", "^amq\." next to
            "Pattern", choose "Exchanges" from the "Apply to" drop down list
            and enter "federation-upstream-set" = "all"
            in the first line next to "Policy". Click "Add" policy.
          </td>
        </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          We tell the policy to federate all exchanges whose names
          begin with "amq." (i.e. all the built in exchanges except
          for the default exchange) with (implicit) low priority, and
          to federate them using the implicitly created upstream set
          "all", which includes our newly-created upstream.  Any other
          matching policy with a priority greater than 0 will take
          precedence over this policy. Keep in mind that <code>federate-me</code>
          is just a name we used for this example, you can use any
          string you want there.
        </p>

        <p>
          The built in exchanges should now be federated because they are
          matched by the policy. You can
          check that the policy has applied to the exchanges by
          checking the exchanges list in management or with:
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-bash">rabbitmqctl list_exchanges name policy | grep federate-me</pre>
        <p>
          And you can check that federation links for each exchange have come up with Admin > Federation Status > Running Links or with:
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-bash">rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_federation_status:status().'</pre>
        <p>
          In general there will be one federation link for each
          upstream that is applied to an exchange. So for example with
          three exchanges and two upstreams for each there will be six
          links.
        </p>

        <p>
          For simple use this should be all you need - you will probably
          want to look at the <a href="uri-spec.html">AMQP URI
          reference</a>. The <a href="federation-reference.html">federation
          reference</a> contains more details on setting up upstreams and
          upstream sets.

    <doc:section name="link-failures">
      <doc:heading>Federation Connection (Link) Failures</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Inter-node connections used by Federation are based on AMQP 0-9-1
        connections. Federation links can be treated as special kind of clients
        by operators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should a link fail, e.g. due to a network interruption, it will
        attempt to re-connect. Reconnection period is a configurable value
        that's defined in upstream definition. See
        <a href="federation-reference.html">federation
        reference</a> for more details on setting up upstreams and
        upstream sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Links generally try to recover ad infinitum but there are scenarios
        when they give up:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Failure rate is too high (max tolerated rate depends on
            upstream's <code>reconnect-delay</code> but is generally a failure
            every few seconds by default).
          </li>
          <li>
            Link no longer can locate its "source" queue or exchange.
          </li>
          <li>
            Policy changes in such a way that a link considers itself no longer
            necessary.
          </li>
        </ul>

        By increasing <code>reconnect-delay</code> for upstreams it is possible
        to tolerate higher link failure rates. This is primarily relevant
        for RabbitMQ installations where a moderate or large number of active links.
      </p>

    <doc:section name="clustering">
      <doc:heading>Federating Clusters</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Clusters can be linked together with federation just as single brokers
        can. To summarise how clustering and federation interact:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can define policies and parameters on any node in the downstream
          cluster; once defined on one node they will apply on all nodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exchange federation links will start on any node in the
          downstream cluster. They will fail over to other nodes if
          the node they are running on crashes or stops.
        </li>
        <li>
          Queue federation links will start on the same node as the
          downstream queue. If the downstream queue is mirrored, they
          will start on the same node as the master, and will be
          recreated on the same node as the new master if the node the
          existing master is running on crashes or stops.
        </li>
        <li>
          To connect to an upstream cluster, you can specify multiple URIs in
          a single upstream. The federation link process will choose one of
          these URIs at random each time it attempts to connect.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </doc:section>


    <doc:section name="tls-connections">
      <doc:heading>Securing Federation Connections with TLS</doc:heading>
      <p>
        Federation connections (links) can be secured with TLS. Because Federation uses
        a RabbitMQ client under the hood, it is necessary to both configure
        source broker to <a href="/ssl.html">listen for TLS connections</a>
        and Federation/Erlang client to use TLS.
      </p>
      <p>
        To configure Federation to use TLS, one needs to

        <ul>
          <li>Use the <code>amqps</code> URI scheme instead of <code>amqp</code></li>
          <li>Specify CA certificate and client certificate/key pair via
          <a href="/uri-query-parameters.html">URI query parameters</a>
          when configuring upstream(s)</li>
          <li><a href="/ssl.html">Configure Erlang client to use TLS</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like with "regular" client connections, server's CA should be
        trusted on the node where federation link(s) runs, and vice versa.

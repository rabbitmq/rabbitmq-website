    <h2>About RabbitMQ</h2>
    <p class="intro">RabbitMQ is an implementation of <a href="specification.html">AMQP</a>, the emerging standard for high performance <a href="faq.html#what-is-messaging">messaging</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a complete and highly reliable Enterprise Messaging
      system. The RabbitMQ client libraries and broker daemon can be
      used together to create an AMQP network, or used individually to
      bring the benefits of RabbitMQ to established networks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Packages/installers are available for all major operating
      systems and platforms. RabbitMQ can also be deployed as a
      VMWare/Debian virtual appliance.

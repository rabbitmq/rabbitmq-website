# RabbitMQ Web MQTT Plugin NOSYNTAX

The Web MQTT plugin is a simple bridge exposing the
[MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) protocol over [HTML5 WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets).

The main intention of Web MQTT is to make it possible to use RabbitMQ
from web browsers. It was heavily inspired by the [Web STOMP plugin](/web-stomp.html).

## <a id="rationale">How It Works</a>

RabbitMQ Web MQTT plugin is rather simple. It takes the MQTT protocol,
as provided by [RabbitMQ MQTT plugin](/mqtt.html) and exposes it using
WebSockets. Note that unlike Web STOMP, this plugin does not provide
WebSocket emulation via SockJS.


## <a id="iwm">Installation and Enabling the Plugin</a>

`rabbitmq_web_mqtt` plugin ships with RabbitMQ as of 3.6.7.

To enable the plugin run [rabbitmq-plugins](/man/rabbitmq-plugins.1.man.html):

    rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_web_mqtt

## <a id="usage">Usage</a>

In order to use MQTT in a Web browser context, a JavaScript MQTT
library is required. We've tested it against
[Paho JavaScript client](https://eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/).
It is included as part of [RabbitMQ Web MQTT example plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-mqtt-examples).

By default the Web MQTT plugin exposes a WebSocket endpoint on port
15675. The WebSocket endpoint is available on the `/ws` path:

    http://127.0.0.1:15675/ws

In order to establish connection from the browser using WebSocket
you may use code like:

    <script src="mqttws31.js"></script>
    <script>

        var wsbroker = location.hostname;  // mqtt websocket enabled broker
        var wsport = 15675; // port for above
        var client = new Paho.MQTT.Client(wsbroker, wsport, "/ws",
            "myclientid_" + parseInt(Math.random() * 100, 10));
        client.onConnectionLost = function (responseObject) {
            debug("CONNECTION LOST - " + responseObject.errorMessage);
        };
        client.onMessageArrived = function (message) {
            debug("RECEIVE ON " + message.destinationName + " PAYLOAD " + message.payloadString);
            print_first(message.payloadString);
        };

Once you have the `client` object you can follow API's exposed by
[Paho JavaScript library](https://eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/). The next step is usually to establish a MQTT
connection with the broker:

        [...]

        var options = {
            timeout: 3,
            onSuccess: function () {
                debug("CONNECTION SUCCESS");
                client.subscribe('/topic/test', {qos: 1});
            },
            onFailure: function (message) {
                debug("CONNECTION FAILURE - " + message.errorMessage);
            }
        };
        if (location.protocol == "https:") {
            options.useSSL = true;
        }
        debug("CONNECT TO " + wsbroker + ":" + wsport);
        client.connect(options);
        [...]


## <a id="examples">Web MQTT Examples</a>

A few simple Web MQTT examples are provided as a
[RabbitMQ Web MQTT examples](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-mqtt-examples)
plugin. To get it running follow the installation instructions for that plugin
and enable the plugin:

    rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_web_mqtt_examples

The examples will be available under
[http://127.0.0.1:15670/](http://127.0.0.1:15670/) url. You will see two examples:

 * "echo" - shows how to use MQTT to do simple message broadcasting
 * "bunny" - example of a simple collaboration canvas painting app

We encourage you to take a look [at the source code](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-mqtt-examples/tree/master/priv).

## <a id="config">Configuration</a>

When no configuration is specified the Web MQTT plugin will listen on
all interfaces on port 15674 and have a default user login and password of
`guest`/`guest`. Note that this user is only [allowed to connect from localhost](/access-control.html) by default.
We highly recommend creating a separate user production systems.

To change this, edit your
[Configuration file](/configure.html#configuration-file),
to contain a `port` variable for the `rabbitmq_web_mqtt` application.

For example, a complete configuration file which changes the listener
port to 12345 would look like:

    web_mqtt.port = 12345

Or using the <a href="/configure.html#erlang-term-config-file">classic config format</a>:


    [
      {rabbitmq_web_mqtt, [{port, 12345}]}
    ].

This is a shorthand for the following:

    [
      {rabbitmq_web_mqtt,
          [{tcp_config, [{port, 12345}]}]}
    ].

You can use the `tcp_config` section to specify any TCP option you need.
When both a `port` and a `tcp_config` sections exist, the plugin will
use the former as a port number, ignoring the one in `tcp_config`.

See [RabbitMQ Networking guide](/networking.html) for more information.


### TLS (SSL)

The plugin supports WebSockets with TLS (WSS) connections. That requires
Erlang/OTP 17.5 or a later version.

TLS (SSL) configuration parameters are provided in the `ssl_config` section:

    web_mqtt.ssl.port = 12345
    web_mqtt.ssl.backlog    = 1024
    web_mqtt.ssl.certfile   = path/to/certs/client/cert.pem
    web_mqtt.ssl.keyfile    = path/to/certs/client/key.pem
    web_mqtt.ssl.cacertfile = path/to/certs/testca/cacert.pem
    web_mqtt.ssl.password   = changeme

Or using the <a href="/configure.html#erlang-term-config-file">classic config format</a>:

    [
      {rabbitmq_web_mqtt,
          [{ssl_config, [{port,       15671},
                         {backlog,    1024},
                         {certfile,   "path/to/certs/client/cert.pem"},
                         {keyfile,    "path/to/certs/client/key.pem"},
                         {cacertfile, "path/to/certs/testca/cacert.pem"},
                         %% needed when private key has a passphrase
                         {password,   "changeme"}]}]}
    ].

Note that port, certfile, keyfile and password are all mandatory. See the [Cowboy documentation](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cowboy/blob/4b93c2d19a10e5d9cee207038103bb83f1ab9436/src/cowboy_ssl_transport.erl#L40)
for details about accepted parameters.

See [RabbitMQ TLS](/ssl.html) and [TLS Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting-ssl.html) for details.

## <a id="encoding">WebSocket Options</a>

The Web MQTT plugin uses the Cowboy web server under the hood.  Cowboy
provides [a number of
options](http://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/1.0/manual/cowboy_protocol/)
that can be used to customize the behavior of the server
w.r.t. WebSocket connection handling. You can specify those in the Web
MQTT plugin configuration, in the `cowboy_opts` section:

    [
      {rabbitmq_web_mqtt,
          [{cowboy_opts, [{max_keepalive, 10}]}]}
    ].

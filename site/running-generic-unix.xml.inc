  <doc:heading>Running and Managing the Node</doc:heading>
  <div class="instructions">
    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Unlike some other installation methods, namely the <a href="/install-debian.html">Debian</a> and <a href="/install-rpm.html">RPM packages</a>, RabbitMQ
      generic UNIX binary build does not require <code>sudo</code>. It can be uncompressed
      into any location and started and managed using the scripts and <a href="/cli.html">CLI tools</a> under <code>sbin</code>.
      Default <a href="/relocate.html">data directory location</a> will be under <code>./var</code>,
      that is, in the installation directory.
    </p>

    <h4>Starting the Server</h4>
    <p>
      To start the server, run the <code>sbin/rabbitmq-server</code> script. This
      displays a short banner message, concluding with the message
      "completed with <i>[n]</i> plugins.", indicating that the
      RabbitMQ broker has been started successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start the server in "detached" mode, use
      <code>rabbitmq-server -detached</code>. This will run
      the node process in the background.
    </p>

    <h4>Stopping the Server</h4>
    <p>
      To stop a running node, use <code>sbin/rabbitmqctl shutdown</code>. The command
      will wait for the node process to stop. If the target node is not running,
      it will exit with an error.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="instructions">
    <h4>Configuring the Server</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">RabbitMQ configuration file</a> located at <code><span class="envvar">$RABBITMQ_HOME</span>/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf</code>
      is the primary way of configuring the node.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to <a href="configure.html#customise-general-unix-environment">use
      environment variables</a> to control certain settings. The recommended way of doing that
      is using the <code><span class="envvar">$RABBITMQ_HOME</span>/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf</code> file.
      Neither of these files exist after installation, so they must be created first.

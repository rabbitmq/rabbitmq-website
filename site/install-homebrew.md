# The Homebrew RabbitMQ Formula

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a popular package manager for MacOS.
[RabbitMQ formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/rabbitmq.rb) is available from
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)'s core tap (out of the box).

The formula will also install a reasonably recent [supported Erlang/OTP version](/which-erlang.html)
as a dependency.


## <a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation">Installation</a>

Before installing make sure the taps are up-to-date:

<pre class="lang-bash">
brew update
</pre>

Then, install RabbitMQ server with:

<pre class="lang-bash">
brew install rabbitmq
</pre>

Installing the RabbitMQ formula will install key dependencies such as a [supported Erlang/OTP version](/which-erlang.html).

## <a id="operations" class="anchor" href="#operations">Operations</a>

The RabbitMQ server scripts and [CLI tools](/cli.html) are installed into the `sbin` directory under `/usr/local/Cellar/rabbitmq/<version>/`,
which is accessible from `/usr/local/opt/rabbitmq/sbin`. Links to binaries have been created under `/usr/local/sbin`.
In case that directory is not in `PATH` it's recommended to append it:

<pre class="lang-bash">
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin
</pre>

Add the above expert to the shell profile (such as `~/.bashrc` for bash or `~/.zshrc` for zsh)
to have `PATH` updated for every new shell, including OS restarts.

The server can then be started with `rabbitmq-server` in the foreground or with `brew services start rabbitmq`
to have it run under launchd in the background.

With Homebrew, the node and CLI tools will use the logged in user account by default.
Using `sudo` is not required.

Otherwise operations are no different from the generic binary build.
Please refer to the [Operations section](install-generic-unix.html#operations) of
the generic binary build guide.

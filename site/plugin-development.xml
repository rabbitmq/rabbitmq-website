        This is the RabbitMQ Server Plugin Development Guide. It is expected that
        before reading this guide, the reader has a basic understanding of the RabbitMQ
        plugin mechanism. Readers are also expected to have a basic
        understanding of Erlang OTP
        <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/system_principles/users_guide.html">system</a> and
        <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/users_guide.html">design</a> principles.

      <doc:section name="why">
        <doc:heading>Why Write A Plugin?</doc:heading>

        <p>
          Writing a RabbitMQ plugin provides a number of appealing possibilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Enable your application to access internal RabbitMQ functionality that is not exposed
            via one of the supported protocols.
          </li>
          <li>
            Running in the same Erlang VM as the broker may increase performance for certain applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plugins provide an easy deployment model, since they allow for a single &quot;RabbitMQ Appliance&quot;
            to be built that acts in a self-contained manner. This can be useful both for easing production
            deployments, and for producing all-in-one infrastructure for use during development.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="why-not">
        <doc:heading>Why To Not Write A Plugin</doc:heading>

        <p>
          As with any plugin mechanism, consideration should be given when developing functionality as to whether
          embedding it as a plugin is the most appropriate path to take. Some reasons that you might not want to
          develop your functionality as a plugin:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Depending on undocumented internal Rabbit APIs can result in your application requiring changes when
            RabbitMQ is updated. If you can do what you need to do without using RabbitMQ internals, then your
            application will be far more compatible in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            As mentioned in the Admin Guide, a poorly written plugin can result in the entire broker crashing!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="getting-started">
        <doc:heading>Getting Started</doc:heading>

        <p>
          To develop a RabbitMQ plugin, first make sure the following
          requirements are met:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ensure that you have a working installation of <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure that the dependencies detailed in the <a href="build-server.html#prerequisites">Server Build</a>
            documentation are installed and functional.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <a href="http://erlang.mk">Erlang.mk</a> is used to
          build RabbitMQ and its plugins. The easiest way to start on
          a new plugin is probably to copy an existing plugin such as
          <tt>rabbitmq-metronome</tt>, <a href="#plugin-hello-world">used
          as an example below</a>.
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="installing-plugins-during-development">
        <doc:heading>Activating Plugins During Development</doc:heading>

        <p>
          To test your plugin while you're working on it, you can start
          a broker with your plugin enabled:
          <pre class="sourcecode bash">make run-broker</pre>
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="plugin-quality-tips">
        <doc:heading>Plugin Quality Tips</doc:heading>

        <p>
          As highlighted in the Administration Guide, badly-written plugins can pose a risk to the stability of the
          broker. The following tips aim to provide a series of best-practices for ensuring that your plugin
          can safely co-exist with Rabbit.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Always install a Supervisor above your application. You should never start your application directly,
            instead opting to create a (possibly quite trivial) supervisor that will prevent the Erlang VM from
            shutting down due to a crashed top-level application.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </doc:section>
      <doc:section name="plugin-version-constraints">
        <doc:heading>Broker and Dependency Version Constraints</doc:heading>
        <p>
            It's possible to specify broker and dependency version
            requirements for a plugin using the
            <code>broker_version_requirements</code> key in plugin's
            <code>.app.src</code> file. The requirements are specified as a list of
            minimum version in each release series.
            Consider the following example:

            <pre class="sourcecode">
{application, my_plugin,[
            ...
            {broker_version_requirements, ["3.5.2", "3.6.1", "3.7.0"]}
]}</pre>

            The above requires RabbitMQ
            3.5.x starting with 3.5.2, 3.6.x starting with 3.6.1 and
            all versions in the 3.7.x series. Note that when new major and minor (feature) RabbitMQ versions
            come out, <strong>it is necessary for plugin maintainers to update the list</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plugins can have dependencies. It is possible to specify supported
            version series for dependencies, too. This is quite similar
            to the above but uses a dictionary-like data structure (proplist).

            For example:

<pre class="sourcecode">
{application, my_plugin, [
            ...
            {dependency_version_requirements, [{rabbitmq_management, ["3.6.1", "3.7.0"]}]}
]}
</pre>

            means the plugin depends on <code>rabbitmq_management</code> 3.6.x starting
            with 3.6.1 and all versions in the 3.7.x series.
        </p>
      </doc:section>

      <doc:section name="plugin-hello-world">
        <doc:heading>Example Plugin: Metronome</doc:heading>

        <p>
          Seeing as no development guide would be complete without a Hello World example, the following tries to
          provide the basics of how your would build your very own RabbitMQ plugin. The following example details
          how you might build a simple plugin that acts like a metronome. Every second, it fires a message that has
          a routing key in the form yyyy.MM.dd.dow.hh.mm.ss to a topic exchange called &quot;metronome&quot; by default.
          Applications can attach queues to this exchange with various routing keys in order to be invoked at regular intervals.
          For example, to receive a message every second, a binding of &quot;*.*.*.*.*.*.*&quot; could be applied. To recieve
          a message every minute, a binding of &quot;*.*.*.*.*.*.00&quot; could be applied instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-metronome">rabbitmq-metronome</a> repository on GitHub
          contains a copy of the code for this plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following table should explain the purpose of the various files in the repository.
        </p>

              Dependencies are declared using erlang.mk's
              variables. Just after that, the Makefile includes
              <tt>rabbitmq-components.mk</tt> and <tt>erlang.mk</tt>,

              this writing. That's why <tt>ERLANG_MK_REPO</tt> and

              extensions take care of starting a node and run the EUnit

              to the internal format used by RabbitMQ and its runtime.

              Metronome schema contains mappings for the <code>metronome.exchange</code> setting,
              setting the exchange used by the plugin. Default value is defined in <code>rabbitmq_metronome.app.src</code>.

              Configuration will be regenerated when the plugin is
              enabled. Plugin-specific values in the config will cause error if
              plugin has not been enabled.

              More information about writing schema files can be found
              <a href="https://github.com/basho/cuttlefish/wiki/Cuttlefish-for-Erlang-Developers">in the Cuttlefish docs</a>.

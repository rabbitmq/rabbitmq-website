       <p class="intro">This page collects some tips to aid the diagnosis of SSL errors.
         The strategy is to test the required components with an alternative SSL
         implementation in a process of elimination to identify the fault.
       </p>
       <p>
         Bear in mind that this process is not guaranteed to identify the problem if
         the interaction between two specific components is responsible for the problem.

       <doc:subsection name="erlang-support">
       <doc:heading>Check SSL support in Erlang</doc:heading>
       <p>
         The first requirement for establishing SSL connections to the broker
         is SSL support in the broker. Confirm that the Erlang VM has support
         for SSL by running the
         <code>erl</code> (or <code>werl.exe</code> on Windows) shell and
         entering <pre class="sourcecode">ssl:versions().</pre>
         The output should look similar to this (with version number differences possible):
         <pre>[{ssl_app,"5.0"},
 {supported,[tlsv1,sslv3]},
 {available,[tlsv1,sslv3]}]</pre>
       </p>
       <p>
         If you receive an error instead, confirm that Erlang was built
         with OpenSSL. On Debian-based systems you may need to install the
         <code>erlang-ssl</code> package, and on Mac OS you may need
         to <code>port install erlang +ssl</code>.
       </p>
       </doc:subsection>

       <doc:subsection name="keys-and-certs">
       <doc:heading>Check keys and certificates with OpenSSL</doc:heading>
       <p>
         We will now verify the certificates and keys specified in the
         <a href="configure.html#configuration-file"> configuration
         file</a> against an alternative SSL implementation. This
         example uses OpenSSL <a
         href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/s_client.html">s_client</a>
         and <a
         href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/s_server.html">s_server</a>.
         We will confirm that the certificates and keys can be used to
         establish a secure link by connecting two terminals. For the
         examples that follow, we will assume you have the following:
       </p>
         <table>
          <tr>
           <td>Item</td>
           <td>Location</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>CA certificate</td>
           <td><code>testca/cacert.pem</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>Server certificate</td>
           <td><code>server/cert.pem</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>Server key</td>
           <td><code>server/key.pem</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>Client certificate</td>
           <td><code>client/cert.pem</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>Client key</td>
           <td><code>client/key.pem</code></td>
          </tr>
         </table>
       <p>
         In one terminal window execute the following command:
         <pre class="sourcecode">openssl s_server -accept 8443 -cert server/cert.pem -key server/key.pem \
  -CAfile testca/cacert.pem</pre>
         In another terminal window execute
         <pre class="sourcecode">openssl s_client -connect localhost:8443 -cert client/cert.pem -key client/key.pem \
  -CAfile testca/cacert.pem</pre>
         If the certificates and keys have been correctly created, an SSL connection establishment
         sequence will appear and the terminals will be linked. Input from either terminal will appear
         on the other. If the trust chain could be established, the second terminal will display
         this confirmation: <pre>Verify return code: 0 (ok)</pre>
       </p>
       <p>
         If you receive an error, confirm that the certificates and keys were
         generated correctly.
       </p>
       </doc:subsection>

       <doc:subsection name="broker-listens">
       <doc:heading>Check broker is listening</doc:heading>
       <p>
         This step checks that the broker is listening on the expected AMQPS port.
         When you start the broker with a valid SSL configuration file, the broker
         will report the SSL listening address in the logfile. You should see an entry
         similar to this:<pre>=INFO REPORT==== 8-Aug-2011::11:51:47 ===
started SSL Listener on 0.0.0.0:5671</pre>
         If you included an "ssl_listeners" configuration directive and you don't see
         this message, it is possible that your configuration file was not read by
         the broker. Confirm that the configuration file quoted in the broker log
         contains SSL configuration options. See the
         <a href="/configure.html#introduction">configuration page</a> for details.
       </p>
       </doc:subsection>

       <doc:subsection name="broker-listens-ssl">
       <doc:heading>Attempt SSL connection to broker</doc:heading>
       <p>
         Once you have a RabbitMQ broker listening on an SSL port you can again use
         the OpenSSL s_client to verify SSL connection establishment, this time against the broker.
         This check establishes whether the broker is likely to be configured correctly,
         without needing to configure an AMQPS client.
         The example assumes a broker with an "ssl_listeners" configuration directive set to listen for
         SSL connections on localhost port 5671:
         <pre class="sourcecode">openssl s_client -connect localhost:5671 -cert client/cert.pem -key client/key.pem \
  -CAfile testca/cacert.pem</pre>
         The output should appear similar to the case where port 8443 was used. The broker logfile
         should contain a new entry when the connection is established:
         <pre>=INFO REPORT==== 8-Aug-2011::11:55:13 ===
accepting AMQP connection &lt;0.223.0> (127.0.0.1:58954 -> 127.0.0.1:5671)</pre>
       </p>
       <p>
         It should now be possible to present the broker with an AMQP connection
         establishment sequence over the SSL connection. If you present the broker
         with eight random bytes, the broker will respond with the string "AMQP"
         followed by an encoded version number. If you recognise the "AMQP" string,
         you can be confident that you are connected to an AMQP broker.
       </p>
      </doc:subsection>

      <doc:subsection>
       <doc:heading>Validate client connections with stunnel</doc:heading>
       <p>
         The final check is to validate AMQPS clients. We will use  <a href="http://www.stunnel.org/">stunnel</a>
         to provide SSL capability. In this configuration AMQPS clients will make a secure connection to stunnel,
         which will pass the decrypted data through to the AMQP port of the broker. This provides some confidence
         that the client SSL configuration is correct independently of the broker SSL configuration.
       </p>
       <p>
         stunnel will run in daemon mode on the same host as the broker. In the discussion that follows it is
         assumed that stunnel will only be used temporarily. It is of course possible to use stunnel to
         provide SSL capability more permanently, but the lack of integration with the broker
         means that management reporting features and authentication plugins that use SSL
         information will not be able to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
         In this example, stunnel will connect to the unencrypted AMQP port of the broker (5672) and accept
         AMQPS connections from SSL-capable clients on port 5679:
         <pre  class="sourcecode">cat client/key.pem client/cert.pem > client/key-cert.pem
stunnel -r localhost:5672 -d 5679 -f -p client/key-cert.pem -D 7</pre>
         stunnel requires a certificate and corresponding key. The generated client certificate
         and corresponding key should be used and concatenated as shown above with the <code>cat</code> command.
         stunnel requires that the key not be password-protected.
       </p>
       <p>
         SSL-capable clients should now be able to connect to port 5679 and any SSL errors will appear
         on the console where stunnel was started.
       </p>
      </doc:subsection>

      <doc:subsection>
       <doc:heading>Connect client and broker</doc:heading>
       <p>
         If none of the previous steps produced errors then you can confidently connect the tested AMQPS
         client to the AMQPS port of the broker, making sure to stop any running OpenSSL or stunnel
         sessions first.
       </p>
      </doc:subsection>
      <doc:section name="logs">
       <doc:heading>Understanding SSL logs</doc:heading>
        <p>
         New broker logfile entries will be generated during many of the preceding steps. These entries
         together with diagnostic output from commands on the console should help to identify the cause
         of SSL errors. What follows is a list of the most common error entries:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>
               Entries containing <code>{ssl_upgrade_error, ekeyfile}</code>
               or <code>{ssl_upgrade_error, ecertfile}</code>
            </dt>
            <dd>
               <p>
                 This means the broker keyfile or certificate file is invalid.
                 Confirm that the keyfile matches the certificate and that both are in PEM format.
                 PEM format is a printable encoding with recognisable delimiters. The certificate
                 will start and end with <code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----</code> and
                 <code>-----END CERTIFICATE-----</code> respectively. The keyfile will likewise
                 start and end with <code>-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</code> and
                 <code>-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</code> respectively.
               </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Entries containing <code>{ssl_upgrade_failure, ... certify ...}</code></dt>
            <dd>
               <p>
                 This error is related to client verification. The client is presenting an invalid
                 certificate or no certificate. If the ssl_options has the <code>verify</code> option
                 set to <code>verify_peer</code> then try using the value <code>verify_none</code>
                 temporarily. Ensure that the client certificate has been generated correctly, and that
                 the client is presenting the correct certificate.
               </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Entries containing <code>{ssl_upgrade_error, ...}</code></dt>
            <dd>
               <p>
                 This is a generic error that could have many causes. Make sure you are
                 using the recommended version of Erlang.

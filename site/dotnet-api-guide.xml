            This section gives an overview of the RabbitMQ .NET client API.

            Only the basics of using the library are covered: for full detail,
            please see the javadoc-like API documentation generated from the
            source code.
        </p>

        <doc:section name="classoverview">
            <doc:heading>Major namespaces, interfaces and classes</doc:heading>
            <p>
                The core API interfaces and classes are defined in the <code>RabbitMQ.Client</code> namespace:

<pre class="sourcecode">
using RabbitMQ.Client;
</pre>

    The core API interfaces and classes are

    <ul>
        <li><code>IModel</code>: represents an AMQP 0-9-1 channel, and provides most
        of the operations (protocol methods).</li>

        <li><code>IConnection</code>: represents an AMQP 0-9-1 connection</li>

        <li><code>ConnectionFactory</code>: constructs <code>IConnection</code> instances</li>

        <li><code>IBasicConsumer</code>: represents a message consumer</li>
    </ul>

    Other useful interfaces and classes include:

    <ul>
      <li><code>DefaultBasicConsumer</code>: commonly used base class for consumers</li>
    </ul>

    Public namespaces other than <code>RabbitMQ.Client</code> include:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>RabbitMQ.Client.Events</code>: various events and event handlers
            that are part of the client library, including <code>EventingBasicConsumer</code>,
            a consumer implementation built around C# event handlers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>RabbitMQ.Client.Exceptions</code>: exceptions visible to the user.
        </li>
    </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            All other namespaces are reserved for private implementation detail of
            the library, although members of private namespaces are usually made
            available to applications using the library in order to permit
            developers to implement workarounds for faults or design mistakes they
            discover in the library implementation. Applications cannot rely on
            any classes, interfaces, member variables etc. that appear within
            private namespaces remaining stable across releases of the library.
          </p>

        <doc:section name="connecting">
          <doc:heading>Connecting to a Broker</doc:heading>
          <p>
            To connect to a RabbitMQ, it is necessary to instantiate a <code>ConnectionFactory</code>
            and configure it to use desired hostname, virtual host, and credentials. Then
            use <code>ConnectionFactory.CreateConnection()</code> to open a connection.

            The following two code snippets connect to a RabbitMQ node on <code>hostName</code>:

<pre>
ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
factory.UserName = user;
// "gue
factory.Password = pass;
factory.VirtualHost = vhost;
factory.HostName = hostName;

IConnection conn = factory.CreateConnection();
</pre>

<pre class="sourcecode">
ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
factory.Uri = "amqp://user:pass@hostName:port/vhost";

IConnection conn = factory.CreateConnection();
</pre>
          </p>

          <p>
            Since the .NET client uses a stricter interpretation of the <a href="/uri-spec.html">AMQP 0-9-1 URI
            spec</a> than the other clients, care must be taken when using URIs.  In
            particular, the host part must not be omitted and virtual hosts with
            empty names are not addressable.

            All factory properties have default values. The default value for a property will be used if the property remains unassigned prior to creating a connection:

            <dl>
              <dt>Username</dt>
              <dd><code>"guest"</code></dd>

              <dt>Password</dt>
              <dd><code>"guest"</code></dd>

              <dt>Virtual host</dt>
              <dd><code>"/"</code></dd>

              <dt>Hostname</dt>
              <dd><code>"localhost"</code></dd>

              <dt>port</dt>
              <dd>
                <code>5672</code> for regular connections,
                <code>5671</code> for connections that use TLS
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </p>

          <p>
            The <code>IConnection</code> interface can then be used to open a channel:

<pre class="sourcecode">
IModel channel = conn.CreateModel();
</pre>

            The channel can now be used to send and receive messages,
            as described in subsequent sections.
          </p>
        </doc:section>

        <doc:section name="using-exchanges-and-queues">
          <doc:heading>Using Exchanges and Queues</doc:heading>

          <p>
            Client applications work with exchanges and queues, the high-level
            building blocks of AMQP 0-9-1. These must be "declared" before they can be
            used. Declaring either type of object simply ensures that one of that
            name exists, creating it if necessary.

            Continuing the previous example, the following code declares an
            exchange and a queue, then binds them together.

<pre class="sourcecode">
model.ExchangeDeclare(exchangeName, ExchangeType.Direct);
model.QueueDeclare(queueName, false, false, false, null);
model.QueueBind(queueName, exchangeName, routingKey, null);
</pre>

            This will actively declare the following objects:

            <ul>
              <li>a non-durable, non-autodelete exchange of "direct" type</li>
              <li>a non-durable, non-autodelete, non-exclusive queue</li>
            </ul>

            The exchange can be customised by using additional parameters.
            The above code then binds the queue to the exchange with the given
            routing key.

            Note that many channel API (<code>IModel</code>) methods are overloaded. The convenient
            short form of <code>ExchangeDeclare</code> uses sensible defaults. There are
            also longer forms with more parameters, to let you override these
            defaults as necessary, giving full control where needed.

            This "short version, long version" pattern is used throughout the API.
          </p>
        </doc:section>

        <doc:section name="publishing">
          <doc:heading>Publishing Messages</doc:heading>

          <p>
            To publish a message to an exchange, use <code>IModel.BasicPublish</code> as
            follows:

<pre class="sourcecode">
byte[] messageBodyBytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello, world!");
model.BasicPublish(exchangeName, routingKey, null, messageBodyBytes);
</pre>

            For fine control, you can use overloaded variants to specify the
            mandatory flag, or specify messages properties:

<pre class="sourcecode">
byte[] messageBodyBytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello, world!");
IBasicProperties props = model.CreateBasicProperties();
props.ContentType = "text/plain";
props.DeliveryMode = 2;
mode.BasicPublish(exchangeName,
                  routingKey, props,
                  messageBodyBytes);
</pre>

            This sends a message with delivery mode 2 (persistent) and
            content-type "text/plain". See the definition of the <code>
            IBasicProperties</code> interface for more information about the available
            header properties.
          </p>
        </doc:section>

        <doc:section name="basic-get">
          <doc:heading>Fetching Individual Messages ("pull API")</doc:heading>

          <p>
            To retrieve individual messages, use <code>IModel.BasicGet</code>. The
            returned value is an instance of BasicGetResult, from which the header
            information (properties) and message body can be extracted:

<pre class="sourcecode">
bool noAck = false;
BasicGetResult result = channel.BasicGet(queueName, noAck);
if (result == null) {
    // No message available at this time.
} else {
    IBasicProperties props = result.BasicProperties;
    byte[] body = result.Body;
    ...
</pre>

            Since <code>noAck = false</code> above, you must also call <code>
            IModel.BasicAck</code> to acknowledge that you have successfully received
            and processed the message:

<pre class="sourcecode">
    ...
    // acknowledge receipt of the message
    channel.BasicAck(result.DeliveryTag, false);
}
</pre>

            Note that fetching messages using this API is relatively inefficient. If you'd prefer
            RabbitMQ to push messages to the client, see the next section.
          </p>
        </doc:section>


        <doc:section name="basic-consume">
          <doc:heading>Retrieving Messages By Subscription ("push API")</doc:heading>

          <p>
            Another way to receive messages is to set up a subscription using the
            <code>IBasicConsumer</code> interface. The messages will then be delivered
            automatically as they arrive, rather than having to be requested
            proactively.

            One way to implement a consumer is to use the
            convenience class <code>EventingBasicConsumer</code>, which dispatches
            deliveries and other consumer lifecycle events as C# events:

<pre class="sourcecode">
var consumer = new EventingBasicConsumer(channel);
consumer.Received += (ch, ea) =>
                {
                    var body = ea.Body;
                    // ... process the message
                    ch.BasicAck(ea.DeliveryTag, false);
                };  
String consumerTag = channel.BasicConsume(queueName, false, consumer);
</pre>

            Another option is to subclass <code>DefaultBasicConsumer</code>,
            overriding methods as necessary, or implement <code>IBasicConsumer</code>
            directly. You will generally want to implement the core method <code>IBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver</code>.

            More sophisticated consumers will need to implement further
            methods. In particular, <code>HandleModelShutdown</code> traps
            channel/connection closure. Consumers can also implement <code>
            HandleBasicCancelOk</code> to be notified of cancellations.

            The <code>ConsumerTag</code> property of <code>DefaultBasicConsumer</code> can be
            used to retrieve the server-generated consumer tag, in cases where
            none was supplied to the original <code>IModel.BasicConsume</code> call.

            You can cancel an active consumer with <code>IModel.BasicCancel</code>:

<pre class="sourcecode">
channel.BasicCancel(consumerTag);
</pre>

When calling the API methods, you always refer to consumers by their
consumer tags, which can be either client- or server-generated as
explained in the <a href="/specification.html">AMQP 0-9-1 specification</a> document.
          </p>
        </doc:section>


        <doc:section name="concurrency">
          <doc:heading>Concurrency Considerations for Consumers</doc:heading>

          <p>
          Each <code>IConnection</code> instance is, in the current implementation,
          backed by a single background thread that reads from the socket and
          dispatches the resulting events to the application.
          If heartbeats are enabled, as of version <code>3.5.0</code>
          they are implemented in terms of .NET timers.

          Usually, therefore, there will be at least two threads active in an application
          using this library:
          </p>

          <dl>
            <dt>the application thread</dt>
            <dd>
              contains the application logic, and makes
              calls on <code>IModel</code> methods to perform protocol operations.
            </dd>

            <dt>the I/O activity thread</dt>
            <dd>
              hidden away and completely managed by the
              <code>IConnection</code> instance.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>
          The one place where the nature of the threading model is visible to
          the application is in any callback the application registers with the
          library. Such callbacks include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>any <code>IBasicConsumer</code> method</li>
            <li>the <code>BasicReturn</code> event on <code>IModel</code></li>
            <li>any of the various shutdown events on <code>IConnection</code>, <code>IModel</code> etc.</li>
          </ul>

          <doc:subsection name="consumer-callbacks-and-ordering">
            <doc:heading>Consumer Callbacks and Ordering</doc:heading>
            <p>
              As of version <code>3.5.0</code> application callback handlers <strong>can</strong> invoke blocking
              operations (such as <code>IModel.QueueDeclare</code> or <code>
              IModel.BasicCancel</code>). <code>IBasicConsumer</code> callbacks are invoked concurrently.
              However, per-channel operation order is preserved. In other word, if messages A and B were delivered
              in this order on the same channel, they will be processed in this order. If messages A and B
              were delivered on different channels, they can be processed in any order (or in parallel).
              Consumer callbacks are invoked in tasks dispatched to the default <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997402%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">TaskScheduler</a>
              provided by the .NET runtime.

          <doc:subsection name="custom-task-scheduler">
            <doc:heading>Using a Custom Task Scheduler</doc:heading>
            <p>
              It is possible to use a custom task scheduler by setting <code>ConnectionFactory.TaskScheduler</code>:

<pre class="sourcecode">
public class CustomTaskScheduler : TaskScheduler
{
  // ...
}

var cf = new ConnectionFactory();
cf.TaskScheduler = new CustomTaskScheduler();
</pre>

              This, for example, can be used to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee789351%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">limit concurrency degree with a custom TaskScheduler</a>.

          <doc:subsection name="model-sharing">
            <doc:heading>Sharing Channels Between Threads</doc:heading>

            <p>
              As a rule of thumb, <code>IModel</code> instances should not be used by more than
              one thread simultaneously: application code should maintain a clear
              notion of thread ownership for <code>IModel</code> instances.

              If more than one thread needs to access a particular <code>IModel</code>
              instances, the application should enforce mutual exclusion itself. One
              way of achieving this is for all users of an <code>IModel</code> to <code>
              lock</code> the instance itself:

<pre class="sourcecode">
IModel ch = RetrieveSomeSharedIModelInstance();
lock (ch) {
  ch.BasicPublish(...);
}
</pre>

              Symptoms of incorrect serialisation of <code>IModel</code> operations
              include, but are not limited to,

              <ul>
                <li>invalid frame sequences being sent on the wire (which occurs, for
                example, if more than one <code>BasicPublish</code> operation is run
                simultaneously), and/or
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>NotSupportedException</code>s being thrown from a method in class
                  <code>RpcContinuationQueue</code> complaining about <code>"Pipelining of
                  requests forbidden"</code> (which occurs in situations where more than
                  one AMQP 0-9-1 synchronous operation, such as <code>ExchangeDeclare</code>, is run
                  simultaneously).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

        </doc:section>


        <doc:section name="basic-return">
          <doc:heading>Handling Unroutable Messages</doc:heading>
          <p>
            If a message is published with the "mandatory" flag
            set, but cannot be delivered, the broker will return it to the sending
            client (via a <code>basic.return</code> AMQP 0-9-1 command).

            To be notified of such returns, clients can subscribe to the <code>
            IModel.BasicReturn</code> event. If there are no listeners attached to the
            event, then returned messages will be silently dropped.

<pre class="sourcecode">
model.BasicReturn +=
  new RabbitMQ.Client.Events.BasicReturnEventHandler(...);
</pre>

            The <code>BasicReturn</code> event will fire, for example, if the client
            publishes a message with the "mandatory" flag set to an exchange of
            "direct" type which is not bound to a queue.

        <doc:section name="disconnecting">
          <doc:heading>Disconnecting from RabbitMQ</doc:heading>
          <p>
            To disconnect, simply close the channel and the connection:

<pre class="sourcecode">
channel.Close(200, "Goodbye");
conn.Close();
</pre>

            Note that closing the channel is considered good practice, but isn't
            strictly necessary - it will be done automatically anyway when the
            underlying connection is closed.

            In some situations, you may want the connection to close automatically
            once the last open channel on the connection closes. To achieve this,
            set the <code>IConnection.AutoClose</code> property to true, but only
            <strong>after</strong> creating the first channel:

<pre class="sourcecode">
IConnection conn = factory.CreateConnection(...);
IModel channel = conn.CreateModel();
conn.AutoClose = true;
</pre>

            When <code>AutoClose</code> is true, the last channel to close will also
            cause the connection to close. If it is set to true before any
            channel is created, the connection will close then and there.

            <p>
              Network connection between clients and RabbitMQ nodes can fail.
              RabbitMQ .NET/C# client supports automatic recovery of connections
              and topology (queues, exchanges, bindings, and consumers).

              The automatic recovery process for many applications follows the following steps:

                <li>Reconnect</li>
                <li>Restore connection listeners</li>
                <li>Re-open channels</li>
                <li>Restore channel listeners</li>
                <li>Restore channel <code>basic.qos</code> setting, publisher confirms and transaction settings</li>
              </ol>

              Topology recovery includes the following actions, performed for every channel

              <ol>
                <li>Re-declare exchanges (except for predefined ones)</li>
                <li>Re-declare queues</li>
                <li>Recover all bindings</li>
                <li>Recover all consumers</li>
              </ol>

              To enable automatic connection recovery, set
              <code>ConnectionFactory.AutomaticRecoveryEnabled</code> to true:

<pre class="sourcecode">
ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
factory.AutomaticRecoveryEnabled = true;
// connection that will recover automatically
IConnection conn = factory.CreateConnection();
</pre>

              If recovery fails due to an exception (e.g. RabbitMQ node is
              still not reachable), it will be retried after a fixed time interval (default
              is 5 seconds). The interval can be configured:

<pre class="sourcecode">
ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
// attempt recovery every 10 seconds
factory.NetworkRecoveryInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
</pre>
            </p>
          </doc:subsection>

          <doc:subsection name="topology-recovery">
            <doc:heading>Topology Recovery</doc:heading>

            <p>
              Topology recovery involves recovery of exchanges, queues, bindings
              and consumers. It is enabled by default but can be disabled:

<pre class="sourcecode">
ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();

Connection conn = factory.CreateConnection();
factory.AutomaticRecoveryEnabled = true;
factory.TopologyRecoveryEnabled  = false;
</pre>
            </p>
          </doc:subsection>

          <doc:subsection name="basic-ack-and-recovery">
            <doc:heading>Manual Acknowledgements and Automatic Recovery</doc:heading>

            <p>
              When manual acknowledgements are used, it is possible that
              network connection to RabbitMQ node fails between message
              delivery and acknowledgement. After connection recovery,
              RabbitMQ will reset delivery tags on all channels.

              This means that <code>basic.ack</code>, <code>basic.nack</code>, and <code>basic.reject</code>
              with old delivery tags will cause a channel exception. To avoid this,
              RabbitMQ .NET client keeps track of and updates delivery tags to make them monotonically
              growing between recoveries.

              <code>IModel.BasicAck</code>,
              <code>IModel.BasicNack</code>, and
              <code>IModel.BasicReject</code> then translate adjusted
              delivery tags into those used by RabbitMQ.

              Acknowledgements with stale delivery tags will not be
              sent. Applications that use manual acknowledgements and automatic
              recovery must be capable of handling redeliveries.

          <doc:heading>Common ways of working with AMQP 0-9-1</doc:heading>

          <p>
            When building distributed systems with RabbitMQ, there are a number of
            different messaging patterns that crop up over and over again. In this
            section, we cover some of the most common coding patterns and
            interaction styles:

            <ul>
              <li>Point-to-point messaging: both remote procedure call (RPC), and
              asynchronous messages directed toward a particular receiver.
              </li>

              <li>
                Event broadcasting: one-to-many interactions; transmission of
                messages directed implicitly to a set of interested receivers, with
                collection of zero or more possible responses.
              </li>

              <li>
                Responsibility transfer: choosing which piece of the network is
                responsible for any given message.
              </li>

              <li>
                Message transfer: at-least-once and at-most-once message delivery.
              </li>

              <li>
                Preserving atomicity and idempotence when interacting with external resources.
              </li>
            </ul>

            Limited library support is also available for working with these
            patterns, in the <code>RabbitMQ.Client.MessagePatterns</code> namespace:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>Subscription</code> provides a high-level interface to receiving
                messages from the server.
              </li>

              <li>
                <code>SimpleRpcServer</code> builds on <code>Subscription</code> to implement
                an RPC or one-way service.
              </li>

              <li>
                <code>SimpleRpcClient</code> builds on <code>Subscription</code> to interact
                with remote services.
              </li>
            </ul>

            Future releases of the RabbitMQ .NET client library will include
            improved high-level support for the most common messaging patterns and
            their variations.
          </p>


        <doc:subsection name="point-to-point-messaging">
          <doc:heading>Point-to-point Messaging</doc:heading>

          <p>
            The point-to-point messaging pattern occurs when the publisher of a
            message has a particular receiving application in mind - for instance,
            when a RPC-style service is made available via the AMQP server, or
            when an application in a workflow chain receives a work item from its
            predecessor and sends the transformed work item to its successor.
          </p>

          <h3>Synchronous, Client-Server Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</h3>

          In order to perform request/response RPC,
          <ul>
            <li>some means of addressing the service must be available</li>
            <li>some means of receiving a reply must be available</li>
            <li>some means of correlating the request message to the reply message
            must be available</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Addressing the service</h4>

          Since AMQP messages are published using a pair of an exchange name and
          a routing key, this is sufficient for addressing a service. Using a
          simple exchange-name/routing-key combination permits a number of
          different ways to implement the service while presenting the same
          interface to clients. For instance, the service could be implemented
          as a single process consuming from a queue, and load-balancing
          internally, or it could be multiple processes consuming from a single
          queue, being handed requests round-robin style, thereby load balancing
          without special coding in the service logic.

          Messages can be addressed to the service request queue either

          <ul>
            <li>directly, using the AMQP default exchange (""); or</li>

            <li>
              indirectly, by using a service-specific exchange, which leaves the
              routing-key free for such purposes as method selection or
              additional service-specific addressing information; or
            </li>

            <li>
              indirectly, by using an exchange shared by multiple services, with
              the service name encoded in the routing key.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Using an exchange other than the default exchange permits other
            applications to receive copies of each request message, which can be
            useful for monitoring, auditing, logging and debugging.

            <h4>Ensuring a service instance is listening</h4>

            <p>
            AMQP 0-9-1 publish operation (<code>IModel.BasicPublish</code>)
            provides a delivery flag, "mandatory", which can be
            used to ensure service availability at the time a
            request is sent by a client.

            Setting the "mandatory" flag causes a request to be returned if it
            cannot be routed to a queue. Returned messages appear as <code>basic.return</code>
            commands, which are made visible to the application via the <code>IModel.BasicReturn</code>
            event on the <code>IModel</code> that was used to publish the message.
            </p>

            <p>
            Since published messages are returned to clients via <code>
            basic.return</code> method, and <code>basic.return</code> is an asynchronous
            negative-acknowledgement event, the <em>absence</em> of a <code>basic.return</code>
            for a particular message cannot be taken as a
            confirmation of delivery: the use of delivery flags only provides a
            way of raising the bar, rather than eliminating failure entirely.
            </p>

            <p>
            Additionally, the fact that a message was flagged "mandatory", and
            successfully enqueued on one or more queues, is no guarantee of its
            eventual receipt: most trivially, the queue could be deleted before
            the message is processed, but other situations, like the use of the
            <code>noAck</code> flag by a message consumer, can also make the guarantee
            provided by "mandatory" conditional.
            </p>

            <p>
            Alternatively, one could use <a href="/confirms.html">Publisher Confirms</a>. Setting a channel
            into <em>confirm mode</em> by calling <code>IModel.ConfirmSelect</code> causes
            the broker to send a <code>Basic.Ack</code> after each message is processed
            by delivering to a ready consumer or by persisting to disk.

            Once a successfully processed message has been confirmed via the <code>IModel.BasicAcks</code>
            event handler, the broker has assumed responsibility
            for the message and the client may consider the message <em>handled</em>.

            Note that the broker may also <em>negatively acknowledge</em> a message by
            sending back a <code>Basic.Nack</code>. In this case, if a message is
            rejected via the <code>IModel.BasicNacks</code> event handler, the client
            should assume that the message was lost or otherwise
            undeliverable. Also, note that unroutable messages - messages published as mandatory to non-existing queues -
            are both <code>Basic.Return'ed</code> and <code>Basic.Ack'ed</code>.
            </p>

            <h4>Receiving Replies</h4>

            AMQP 0-9-1 content header (<code>IBasicProperties</code>) contains a
            field called <code>ReplyTo</code>, which can be used to tell the service where to post
            a reply to a received RPC request. Across current RabbitMQ client
            libraries, the most widely-used formats for the string in the
            <code>ReplyTo</code> header is a simple queue name, although passing an exchange
            name and routing key joined by application-specific rules is also an option.

            The service instance will post its reply to the named destination, and
            the requesting client should arrange to receive messages so addressed,
            using either <code>BasicGet</code> or <code>BasicConsume</code> on an
            appropriately-bound queue.

            <h4>Correlating a received reply to a transmitted request</h4>

            <code>IBasicProperties</code> contain a
            field called <code>CorrelationId</code>, which in AMQP 0-9-1 is an
            unstructured string that can be used to match a request to a reply. A
            reply message should have the same <code>CorrelationId</code> as the one
            that was attached to the request message.

            <h2>Asynchronous, one-way messaging</h2>

            In some situations, a simple request-reply interaction pattern is
            inappropriate for your application. In these cases, the interaction
            pattern of interest can be constructed from asynchronous, one-way,
            point-to-point messages.

            If an application is to respond to both synchronous, RPC-style
            requests, and asynchronous one-way requests, it should use the value
            of <code>ReplyTo</code> to decide which interaction style is being requested
            of it: if <code>ReplyTo</code> is present and non-empty, the request can be
            assumed to be an RPC-style call; otherwise, it should be assumed to be
            a one-way message.

            The <code>CorrelationId</code> field can be used to group together a number
            of related messages, just as for the RPC-style case, but more
            generally tying together an arbitrary number of messages.

            <h3>Acknowledgment modes for point-to-point</h3>

            AMQP can operate in one of two modes, when receiving messages from the
            server: auto-acknowledgement mode (when the <code>noAck</code> flag has been
            set on <code>BasicGet</code>, <code>BasicConsume</code>, or the <code>
            Subscription</code> constructor), or manual-acknowledgement mode. Choosing
            the right acknowledgement mode is important for your application:

            <ul>
              <li>
                auto-acknowledgement mode means that the server will internally
                mark a message as successfully delivered as it transmits it across
                the network. Messages delivered in auto-acknowledgement mode will
                not generally be redelivered to any other receiver.
              </li>

              <li>
                manual-acknowledgement mode means that the server will wait for
                positive confirmation of receipt before marking a message as
                successfully delivered. Messages delivered in
                manual-acknowledgement mode will be re-queued if the channel
                (<code>IModel</code>) they were delivered on is closed before
                an acknowledgement is received by the server.
              </li>
            </ul>

            In general,

            <ul>
              <li>
                if a service is in manual-acknowledgement mode, it should not
                acknowledge the request message until it has replied to it; see the
                section below on interaction with external resources.
              </li>
              <li>
                a client may use auto-acknowledgement mode, depending on the
                consequences of a retransmission of the request message.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Library support for point-to-point messaging</h3>

            The RabbitMQ .NET client library includes basic support for common
            tasks involving point-to-point messaging.

            <h4>SimpleRpcServer</h4>

            The class <code>RabbitMQ.Client.MessagePatterns.SimpleRpcServer</code>
            implements synchronous RPC-style request handling as well as
            asynchronous message handling. Users should subclass <code>
            SimpleRpcServer</code>, overriding one or more of the methods with names
            beginning with "<code>Handle</code>".

            <code>SimpleRpcServer</code> instances have a request-dispatching loop,
            <code>MainLoop</code>, which interprets a request as an RPC-style request
            needing a reply if the <code>ReplyTo</code> field of the request's <code>
            IBasicProperties</code> is non-null and non-empty. Requests with absent or
            empty <code>ReplyTo</code> fields are treated as one-way.

            When an RPC-style request has been processed, the reply is sent to the
            <code>ReplyTo</code> address. The reply address is first matched against a
            regular-expression describing the URI-like syntax given above; if it
            matches, the components of the URI-like syntax are used as the reply
            address, and if it does not, the whole string is used as a simple
            queue name, and the reply is sent to the default exchange ("") with a
            routing-key equal to the <code>ReplyTo</code> string.

            <h4>SimpleRpcClient</h4>

            The class <code>RabbitMQ.Client.MessagePatterns.SimpleRpcClient</code>
            implements code for interacting with <code>SimpleRpcServer</code>s or
            similar.

            RPC-style interactions are performed with the <code>Call</code> methods. A
            (private) <code>Subscription</code> is set up to receive replies from the
            service, and the <code>ReplyTo</code> field is set to point to the
            subscription. The <code>CorrelationId</code> field of the request is
            initialised to a fresh GUID. Asynchronous/one-way interactions are
            simply passed on to <code>IModel.BasicPublish</code> without modification:
            it is up to the caller to set <code>CorrelationId</code> in the asynchronous
            case.

            The class currently has no support for setting the "mandatory" flag
            on a published request message, nor for handling any
            <code>BasicReturn</code> events that might arise from setting that flag.

            The code that retrieves replies from the internal <code>Subscription</code>
            currently cannot deal with multiple simultaneously outstanding RPC
            requests, because it requires that replies arrive in the same order as
            the requests were sent out. Do not attempt to pipeline requests sent
            through a single instance of <code>SimpleRpcClient</code> until this
            restriction has been lifted. See also the overridable protected method
            <code>SimpleRpcClient.RetrieveReply</code>.

            The basic pattern for using <code>SimpleRpcClient</code> is as follows:

<pre class="sourcecode">
using (IConnection conn = new ConnectionFactory()
                                .CreateConnection(args[0])) {
    using (IModel ch = conn.CreateModel()) {

        SimpleRpcClient client = new SimpleRpcClient(ch, /* ... */);
        // in the line above, the "..." indicates the parameters
        // used to specify the address to use to route messages
        // to the service.

        // The next three lines are optional:
        client.TimeoutMilliseconds = 5000; // defaults to infinity
        client.TimedOut += new EventHandler(TimedOutHandler);
        client.Disconnected += new EventHandler(DisconnectedHandler);

        byte[] replyMessageBytes = client.Call(requestMessageBytes);
        // other useful overloads of Call() and Cast() are
        // available. See the code documentation of SimpleRpcClient
        // for full details.
    }
}
</pre>

            Note that a single <code>SimpleRpcClient</code> instance can perform many
            (sequential) <code>Call()</code> and <code>Cast()</code> requests! It is
            recommended that a single <code>SimpleRpcClient</code> be reused for
            multiple service requests, so long as the requests are strictly
            sequential.

        <doc:subsection name="">
          <doc:heading>Event Broadcasting</doc:heading>
          <p>
          The event broadcasting pattern occurs when an application wishes to
          indicate a state change or other notification to a pool of
          applications without knowing precisely the addresses of each
          interested party. Applications interested in a certain subset of
          events use exchanges and queue-bindings to configure which
          events are routed to their own private queues.
          </p>

          <p>
          Generally, events will be broadcast through <code>topic</code> exchanges,
          although <code>direct</code> exchanges, while less flexible, can sometimes
          perform better for applications where their limited pattern-matching
          capability is sufficient.
          </p>

          <h3>Publishing events</h3>

          To publish an event, first ensure the exchange exists, then  determine an appropriate routing key.
          For example, for stocks, a key such as `stock.ibm.nyse` might be appropriate; for other
          applications, other topic hierarchies will naturally arise. <code>topic</code> exchanges
          are commonly used. Then publish the message. For example:

<pre class="sourcecode">
using (IConnection conn = new ConnectionFactory()
                                .CreateConnection(args[0])) {
    using (IModel ch = conn.CreateModel()) {

        IBasicProperties props = ch.CreateBasicProperties();
        FillInHeaders(props); // or similar
        byte[] body = ComputeBody(props); // or similar

        ch.BasicPublish("exchangeName",
                        "chosen.routing.key",
                        props,
                        body);
    }
}
</pre>
          See the documentation for the various overloads of <code>BasicPublish</code>
          on class <code>RabbitMQ.Client.IModel</code>.

          <h3>Subscription</h3>

          The class <code>RabbitMQ.Client.MessagePatterns.Subscription</code>
          implements most of the boilerplate of receiving messages (including,
          in particular, broadcast events) for you, including consumer
          declaration and management, but excluding queue and exchange
          declaration and queue binding. For example,

<pre class="sourcecode">
// "IModel ch" in scope.
Subscription sub = new Subscription(ch, "STOCK.IBM.#");
foreach (BasicDeliverEventArgs e in sub) {
  // handle the message contained in e ...
  // ... and finally acknowledge it
  sub.Ack(e);
}
</pre>

          will start a consumer on the queue using <code>IModel.BasicConsume</code>.
          It is assumed that the queue and any bindings have been previously
          declared.

          <code>Subscription.Ack()</code> should be called for each received event,
          whether or not auto-acknowledgement mode is used, because <code>
          Subscription</code> internally knows whether an actual network message for
          acknowledgement is required, and will take care of it for you in an
          efficient way so long as <code>Ack()</code> is always called in your code.

          For full details, please see the code documentation for the <code>
          Subscription</code> class.

          <h3>Retrieving events with a custom consumer</h3>

          Sometimes the high-level approach using <code>Subscription</code> is
          sufficient. Other times, however, there is a need to use a custom consumer.
          This approach to retrieving events
          is to bind a queue to the exchange concerned with an appropriate
          routing-key pattern specification. For instance, assuming that our
          application wanted to retrieve all prices regarding IBM on queue
          "MyApplicationQueue":

<pre class="sourcecode">
// "IModel ch" in scope.
ch.ExchangeDeclare("prices", "topic");
ch.QueueDeclare("MyApplicationQueue", false, true, true, null);
ch.QueueBind("MyApplicationQueue", "prices",
             "STOCK.IBM.#", false, null);
</pre>

          ... followed by consumption of messages from "MyApplicationQueue"
          using <code>BasicGet</code> or <code>BasicConsume</code>. A more full example is
          given in the ApiOverview chapter.

          <h3>Acknowledgment modes for event broadcasting</h3>

          <p>
          The same auto-acknowledgement/manual-acknowledgement decision as for
          point-to-point messaging is available for consumers of broadcast
          events, but the pattern of interaction introduces different tradeoffs:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              for high-volume messaging where it is occasionally acceptable to
              not receive one of the messages one is interested in,
              auto-acknowledgement mode makes sense
            </li>

            <li>
              for scenarios where every message matching our subscription needs
              to be delivered, manual-acknowledgement is appropriate
            </li>
          </ul>

            <p>
            For more information, see the section on reliable message transfer
            below.
            Note also that class <code>Subscription</code> takes care of acknowledgement
            and the various acknowledgement modes for you, so long as <code>
            Subscription.Ack()</code> is called for each received message.

          <p>
            Messages can be transported between endpoints with different
            quality-of-service (QoS) levels. In general, failure cannot be
            completely ruled out, but it is important to understand the various
            delivery failure modes to understand the kinds of recovery from
            failure that are required, and the kinds of situation for which
            recovery is possible.

            To reiterate: it is not possible to completely rule out failure. The
            best that can be done is to narrow the conditions in which failure can
            occur, and to notify a system operator when failure is detected.
          </p>

          <h3>At-least-once delivery</h3>

          <p>
            This QoS level assures that a message is delivered to its ultimate
            destination at least once. That is, a receiver may receive multiple
            copies of the message. If it is important that a side-effect only
            occur once for a given message, at-most-once delivery should be used instead.
          </p>

          To implement at-least-once delivery:

          <ul>
            <li>
              publish the message as usual, with some correlation identifier and
              reply-to address on it so that the receiver can acknowledge receipt
              to the sender.

              when receiving a message, send an acknowledgement message back to
              the sender. If the message is an RPC request, then the RPC reply
              message is implicitly an acknowledgement of receipt of the request.
            </li>

            <li>
              Alternatively, rather than implement the round-trip logic manually, a
              client may use Publisher Confirms. By enabling Confirm mode on a
              channel, a client is requesting that the broker acknowledge or
              negatively acknowledge all messages sent on the channel from that
              point on.  See the instructions from Responsibility Transfer on how to
              use confirms.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Deciding on a message-resend policy can be difficult. Some simple
          resend strategies are:

            <ul>
              <li>
                resend if your connection is lost or some other crash occurs before
                you receive confirmation of receipt
              </li>

              <li>
                timeout and resend if you do not receive a confirmation within a
                few seconds. Make sure to double the timeout for each resend, to
                help avoid retry-related denial-of-service and network congestion.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3> At-most-once delivery</h3>

            For at-most-once delivery, simply publish the message,
            once, as usual. No correlation identifier is required.
            Receive the message in the consuming application, paying
            attention to the <code>Redelivered</code> flag on the
            delivery. The <code> Redelivered</code> flag will only be
            clear when the server believes that it is offering a
            message for consumption for the very first time. If any
            attempt at delivery has been made before, the
            <code>Redelivered</code> flag will be set.

            The <code>Redelivered</code> flag is a very limited piece of information,
            giving only at-most-once semantics.

        <doc:section name="working-with-clusters">
          <doc:heading>Coding with multi-node RabbitMQ clusters</doc:heading>
          <p>
            In situations where continuous service is desired, the
            possibility of a server failure can be hedged against with some
            careful programming and the availability of a warm-standby cluster
            for failover.
          </p>

          The main concerns when failing over are

          <ul>
            <li>atomicity of published/acknowledged work units, and</li>
            <li>availability of configured resources on the backup server</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Message producers should take care to use transactions in order to
            receive positive confirmation of receipt of a group of messages from a
            server, and should keep a record of the exchanges, queues and bindings
            they need to have available in order to perform their work, so that on
            failover, the appropriate resources can be declared before replaying
            the most recent transactions to recover.
          </p>

          <p>
            Message consumers should be aware of the possibility of missing or
            duplicate messages when failing over: a publisher may decide to resend
            a transaction whose outcome is in doubt, or a transaction the
            publisher considered complete could disappear entirely due to failure
            of a cluster node.
          </p>

        <doc:subsection name="external-resources">
          <doc:heading>Interacting with external resources</doc:heading>
          A common pattern for a service is to

          <ul>
            <li>receive a service request via a queue</li>
            <li>update some external resource, such as a file or database</li>

            <li>reply over RabbitMQ, or at a minimum, acknowledge to the server
            that the message triggering the action has been completed</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Often elements of the at-least-once pattern appear in
            conjunction with the external-resource pattern - specifically, the
            side-effects discussed in the section on reliable message transfer
            above are often effects on an external resource.
          </p>

          <p>
            In cases where a delivery must be processed no more than once and used in conjunction with an
            external resource, it's important to write code that is able at each
            step to determine whether the step has already been taken in some
            previous attempt at completing the whole transaction, and if it has,
            to be able to omit it in this attempt and proceed to the next
            step. For example:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              If a work-triggering request went missing, another copy will
              (eventually) arrive from the ultimate requestor.
            </li>

            <li>
              If the work was already performed, for instance a database table
              was updated, in a previous receipt of the work item in question,
              the service needs to keep a record of completion of the external
              work that is atomic with respect to the atomic work itself: for
              instance, within the same database transaction, some log of
              honoured requests could be updated, or the row being modified could
              be updated to include the ID of the request that caused the
              modification, as well as previous request-IDs that modified the row
              in question.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This makes it important to be able to compress request IDs so that
            they do not take unbounded space in the log of performed work, and
            so that we do not need to introduce a full distributed
            garbage-collection protocol with the ultimate requestor. One way of
            doing this is to choose to use request IDs that are strictly
            increasing, so that a "high water mark" can be used.

            Once the work is known to have been performed, and a reply has been
            produced (if there is one), the reply can be sent back to the
            requestor as many times as necessary. The requestor knows which
            replies it is expecting, and can discard unwanted duplicates. So
            long as duplicates of the same request always receive identical
            reply messages, the replier need not be careful about sending too
            many copies of the reply.

            Once the reply has been sent to the server, the request
            message can be acknowledged as received and processed with the server
            server. In cases where there is no reply to a request, the
            acknowledgement is still useful to ensure that requests are not lost.

        <doc:section name="rabbitmq-binding-for-wcf">
          <doc:heading>A RabbitMQ Binding for WCF</doc:heading>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731082(v=vs.100).aspx">Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)</a> enabled
            protocol independent service oriented applications to be
            built; RabbitMQ .NET client extends the framework by providing a
            <code>Binding</code> and <code>Transport Binding Element</code> over RabbitMQ. In the
            language of WCF, a <code>Binding</code> is a stack of <code>Binding Elements</code>
            which control all aspects of the service’s communication
            (for example, Security, Message Format and
            Transactions). A specialized kind of Binding Element, the
            <code>Transport Binding Element</code> specifies the protocol to be
            used for communication between a service and its clients
            (for example WS-HTTP, MSMQ or .Net Remoting over TCP).
          </p>
          <p>
            The RabbitMQ Binding provides <em>OneWay</em> ("Fire and Forget"),
            <em>TwoWay</em> (Request/Reply) and <em>Duplex</em> (Asynchronous Callback)
            communication over RabbitMQ with <code>WS-ReliableSessions</code>,
            <code>WS-AtomicTransactions</code> and <code>Text</code> message
            encoding. The binding can be configured from imperative
            code or using the standard WCF Configuration model.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <code>Transport Binding Element</code> is also supplied and can be
            used in the construction of custom bindings if the channel
            stack provided by the <code>RabbitMQ Binding</code> is
            insufficient. The transport binding must be configured
            with a broker hostname and broker port prior to use.
          </p>

          <doc:subsection name="status-and-limitations">
            <doc:heading>Status and Known Limitations</doc:heading>

            <ol>
              <li>A <code>TwoWay</code> or <code>Duplex</code> service cannot have <code>SessionMode</code> = <code>SessionMode.NotAllowed</code> since a Reliable Session is required to maintain the reply channel.</li>
              <li>Only SOAP Formatting is available, other formatters can be specified by building a <code>CustomBinding</code> on top of the <code>RabbitMQTransportBindingElement</code></li>
              <li>Service queue parameters (e.g. durability) are not configurable</li>
              <li>Network faults are not reported to the binding</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              The RabbitMQ WCF binding has limited flexibility
              compared to the RabbitMQ .NET RabbitMQ client
              library. You are advised to use the .NET RabbitMQ client
              library if you require greater flexibility (e.g. control
              over durability of service queue) or if you require
              long-term support. The WCF binding is <strong>not under active development</strong>.

          </doc:subsection>

          <doc:subsection name="building-samples">
            <doc:heading>Building the Binding and Samples</doc:heading>

            <p>
              The RabbitMQ binding to WCF and associated samples can be built automatically using Nant. For more information about Nant, visit http://nant.sourceforge.net/. To build the library and Sample Applications from a console window, change to the RabbitMQ.net drop location and execute:

<pre class="sourcecode">
nant build-wcf
nant wcf-examples
</pre>
            </p>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>src\wcf\RabbitMQ.ServiceModel\RabbitMQ.ServiceModel.csproj</li>
                <li>src\wcf\Test\RabbitMQ.ServiceModel.Test.csproj</li>
              </ul>

              The WCF Binding is built into the RabbitMQ.ServiceModel.dll assembly
              and copied to the bin directory of the RabbitMQ.ServiceModel project
              and the sample applications are built into the bin directory of the
              Test project. To run the sample applications (verifying the build and
              your environment configuration) execute the
              RabbitMQ.ServiceModel.Test.exe application.  By default, the sample
              applications use a test broker which must be running at localhost. You
              can modify the broker hostname and port by opening and editing the
              <code>appSettings</code> section of the Application Configuration file (<code>App.Config</code>)
              for the Test Project.

            <p>
              Each Windows Communication Foundation service is built from three components, an Address, Behaviours and a Contract. For more information, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee354181.aspx">Windows Communication Foundation Essentials</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>Contract</h4>
            <p>
              A service contract is an interface decorated with the
              ServiceContractAttribute and has one or more methods (or
              property accessors) decorated with the
              <code>OperationContract</code> attribute. Typically the contract
              exists in an assembly that can be shared between client
              and server applications.

<pre class="sourcecode">
[ServiceContract]
public interface ICalculator
{
  [OperationContract]
  int Add(int x, int y);

  [OperationContract]
  int Subtract(int x, int y);
}
</pre>
            </p>

            <h4>Behaviour</h4>
            <p>
              The contract for a service specifies what the operations
              the service agrees to provide, the behaviour specifies
              the implementation for that service. A behaviour is a
              class implementing the contract and optionally decorated
              with the <code>ServiceBehavior</code> attribute.

<pre class="sourcecode">
[ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode=InstanceContextMode.PerCall)]
public sealed class Calculator : ICalculator
{
  public int Add(int x, int y)
  {
    return x + y;
  }

  public int Subtract(int x, int y)
  {
    return x - y;
  }
}
</pre>
            </p>

            <h4>Address</h4>
            <p>
              For a service to be useful, it must be reachable and
              therefore hosted. The two common hosting scenarios for
              WCF services are IIS and ServiceHost. IIS Hosting is
              untested and unsupported by the RabbitMQ binding and
              using <code>System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost</code> is the recommended
              hosting path. A service host instance is constructed
              with the type of service behaviour being hosted and a
              description of the endpoint(s) it will be published
              on. The endpoints consist of Addresses
              (e.g. <code>soap.amp:///MyService</code>) and Bindings; they may be
              specified directly as constructor arguments in
              imperative code or declaratively through WCF
              configuration files, both are supported by the RabbitMQ
              binding.
            </p>

            <h4>Service Addressing</h4>
            <p>
              Services hosted using the RabbitMQ binding must be
              hosted at addresses under the <code>soap.amqp</code> scheme. The
              <code>amq.direct</code> exchange is used. The service name must not
              be omitted.

<pre class="sourcecode">
serviceAddress = “soap.amqp:///” serviceName
</pre>
            </p>
          </doc:subsection>

            <doc:heading>Sample Services</doc:heading>

            <p>The sample services referred to in this section are located in the <code>src\wcf\Test project</code>.</p>

            <h4>One Way Services</h4>
            <p>
              Operations on a service can be marked as <code>One Way</code>; this
              means there will be no response from the service when
              the operation completes. <code>One Way</code> operations always have
              return type void and have an <code>OperationContract</code> attribute
              with <code>IsOneWay</code> set equal to true decorating them.
            </p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
[OperationContract(IsOneWay=true)]
void Log(LogData entry);
</pre>

            <p>
              If a service only contains one way operations the
              RabbitMQ binding can be used in an optimized <code>OneWayOnly</code>
              mode. In this mode, no reply queue is created for
              responses to be sent back to the client and the client
              does not listen for responses from the service. To
              enable <code>OneWayOnly</code> mode set the binding property or use
              the <code>oneWay</code> configuration attribute.
            </p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
&lt;rabbitMQBinding&gt;
  &lt;binding name="rabbitMQConfig"
           hostame="localhost"
           port="5672"
           username="guest"
           password="guest"
           virtualHost="/"
           oneWay="true"
           maxmessagesize="8192" /&gt;
&lt;/rabbitMQBinding&gt;
</pre>

            <p>
              The <code>OneWayTest</code> sample application is a simple logging
              service. Clients submit log entries to a server which
              displays them on the console. It demonstrates one way
              RPC over RabbitMQ, SOAP encoding to transmit complex data
              types over the wire and singleton instance context mode.
            </p>

            <h4>Two Way Services</h4>
            <p>
              Typically a service operates in a bi-directional, two
              way fashion where requests from the client are
              synchronously executed and a response returned to the
              caller. To support these services, the RabbitMQ binding
              uses the <code>CompositeDuplexBindingElement</code> , which
              constructs a uniquely named reply queue on the
              broker. Two Way services are not supported by the
              binding when it is in <code>OneWayOnly</code> mode.  The <code>TwoWayTest</code>
              sample application is a calculator service, whose
              operations take a pair of integers and return a third.
            </p>

            <h4>Sessionful Services</h4>
            <p>
              Each call to a service can be considered independent of all others
              with the service maintaining no state, often a more useful service
              maintains some state between calls. The RabbitMQ binding supports
              <code>WS-ReliableSessions</code> enable the object instances used to service
              requests to have a session-long lifetime and be associated with a
              single client session. <code>The SessionTest</code> sample application is a cart
              service, allowing items to be added to a cart and a total calculated.
            </p>

            <h4>Duplex Services</h4>
            <p>
              A call to a two way service might start a long running process (for
              example, aggregating prices from a list of suppliers) and whilst the
              client requires a response, it is desirable that the client is not
              blocked for the duration of the call; instead, an asynchronous call is
              desired. Duplex services allow the service to make calls to the
              client, and have a contract whose <code>ServiceContract</code> specifies a
              <code>CallbackContract</code> type.
            </p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
[ServiceContract(CallbackContract=typeof(IOrderCallback))]
public interface IOrderService
</pre>

            <p>
              Duplex services are supported by the RabbitMQ binding because its
              channel stack includes the composite duplex binding element, they
              are not supported in <code>OneWayOne</code> mode. The <code>DuplexTest</code> sample
              application is an ordering service, which makes a callback to the
              client when an order is fulfilled.

            <doc:heading>Using the RabbitMQ Binding</doc:heading>

            <h4>Services</h4>
            <p>
              The recommended hosting scenario for services over RabbitMQ is self
              hosting using <code>System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost</code>. The
              ServiceHost must specify a base or absolute endpoint address under the
              soap.amqp scheme. An endpoint should then be added to the service
              using the <code>RabbitMQBinding</code>.
            </p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
var service = new ServiceHost(typeof(Calculator), new Uri("soap.amqp:///"));
var binding = new RabbitMQBinding("localhost", 5672, "guest", "guest", "/",
                                  8192, Protocols.AMQP_0_9_1);

service.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(ICalculator), binding, "Calculator");
</pre>

            <h4>Clients</h4>
            <p>
              The recommended pattern for connecting to a service is
              by deriving from either <code>ClientBase&lt;T&gt;</code> or
              <code>DuplexClientBase&lt;T&gt;</code>. For duplex clients, the
              <code>InstanceContext</code> must be specified.
            </p>

            <h4>Configuration Files</h4>
            <p>
              Specifying details like the protocol version and broker
              address in source code tends to result in services which
              are very hard to manage and deploy. To avoid this, WCF
              provides a configuration mechanism using application
              configuration files (App.Config). The configuration file
              must be applied to the host or client assembly
              (typically an executable) and not to a library which
              contains the service contract or behaviours. To
              declaratively configure a service, the
              RabbitMQBindingSection must be imported into the
              system.serviceModel section of the configuration file.
            </p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
&lt;extensions&gt;
  &lt;bindingExtensions&gt;
    &lt;add
      name="rabbitMQBinding"
      type="RabbitMQ.ServiceModel.RabbitMQBindingSection, RabbitMQ.ServiceModel, Version=1.0.110.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"/&gt;
  &lt;/bindingExtensions&gt;
&lt;/extensions&gt;
</pre>

            <p>
              With the extension imported, the <code>rabbitMQBinding</code> can be declared and configured:
            </p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
&lt;bindings&gt;
  &lt;rabbitMQBinding&gt;
    &lt;binding
      name="rabbitMQConfig"
      hostname="localhost"
      port="5672"
      maxmessagesize="8192"
      version="AMQP_0_9_1" /&gt;
  &lt;/rabbitMQBinding&gt;
&lt;/bindings&gt;
</pre>

            <h4>Service Configuration</h4>
            <p>
              A service is configured by declaring the contract,
              endpoint and binding. Multiple services and bindings can
              be specified in a single configuration file.
            </p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
&lt;services&gt;
  &lt;service name="Calculator"&gt;
    &lt;host&gt;
      &lt;baseAddresses&gt;
        &lt;add baseAddress="soap.amq:///" /&gt;
      &lt;/baseAddresses&gt;
    &lt;/host&gt;
    &lt;endpoint
      address="Calculator"
      binding="rabbitMQBinding"
      bindingConfiguration="rabbitMQConfig"
      contract="ICalculator"/&gt;
  &lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/services&gt;
</pre>

            <p>
              To run the service, simply create a new ServiceHost
              instance passing in the service behaviour (as specified
              in config).
            </p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
host = new ServiceHost(typeof(Calculator));
host.Open();
</pre>

            <h4>Client Configuration</h4>
            <p>
              To build a client whose settings are derived from
              configuration, expose a constructor for your
              <code>ClientBase&lt;T&gt;</code> derived class calling the
              <code>ClientBase(string)</code>.
            </p>
<pre class="sourcecode">
public class CalculatorClient : ClientBase&lt;ICalculator&gt;, ICalculator
{

    public CalculatorClient(string configurationName)
        : base(configurationName) { }

</pre>

            <p>Construct the class passing the client endpoint name as specified in configuration.</p>
<pre class="sourcecode">
&lt;client&gt;
  &lt;endpoint address="soap.amq:///Calculator"
            binding="rabbitMQBinding"
            bindingConfiguration="rabbitMQConfig"
            contract=" ICalculator"
            name="AMQPCalculatorService" /&gt;
&lt;/client&gt;
</pre>

            <p>
              The RabbitMQ WCF libraries also have full support for the WCF Configuration Editor Tool.

        <p>
          A RabbitMQ <i>broker</i> is a logical grouping of one or
          several Erlang <i>nodes</i>, each running the RabbitMQ
          <i>application</i> and sharing users, virtual hosts,
          queues, exchanges, bindings, and runtime parameters. Sometimes we refer to the collection
          of nodes as a <i>cluster</i>.
        </p>


        <doc:subsection name="overview-what-is-replicated">
          <doc:heading>What is Replicated?</doc:heading>
          <p>
            All data/state required for the operation of a RabbitMQ
            broker is replicated across all nodes. An exception to this
            are message queues, which by default reside on one node,
            though they are visible and reachable from all nodes. To
            replicate queues across nodes in a cluster, see the
            documentation on <a href="ha.html">high availability</a>
            (note that you will need a working cluster first).
          </p>
        </doc:subsection>

        <doc:subsection name="overview-hostname-requirements">
          <doc:heading>Hostname Resolution Requirements</doc:heading>
          <p>
            RabbitMQ nodes address each other using domain names,
            either short or fully-qualified (FQDNs). Therefore
            hostnames of all cluster members
            must be resolvable from all cluster nodes, as well
            as machines on which command line tools such as <code>rabbitmqctl</code>
            might be used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hostname resolution can use any of the standard OS-provided
            methods:

            <ul>
              <li>DNS records</li>
              <li>Local host files (e.g. <code>/etc/hosts</code>)</li>
            </ul>

            In more restrictive environments, where DNS record or
            hosts file modification is restricted, impossible or
            undesired, <a
            href="http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/inet_cfg.html">Erlang
            VM can be configured to use alternative hostname
            resolution methods</a>, such as an alternative DNS server,
            a local file, a non-standard hosts file location, or a mix
            of methods.  Those methods can work in concert with the
            standard OS hostname resolution methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            To use FQDNs, see <code>RABBITMQ_USE_LONGNAME</code> in the <a href="/configure.html#define-environment-variables">Configuration guide</a>.

        <doc:subsection name="overview-cluster-formation-and-membership">
          <doc:heading>Cluster Formation</doc:heading>
          <p>
            A RabbitMQ cluster can formed in a number of ways:

            <ul>
              <li>Declaratively by <a href="/autoclustering.html">listing cluster nodes</a> in <a href="/configure.html">config file</a></li>
              <li>Declaratively using <a href="/autoclustering.html">DNS-based discovery</a></li>
              <li>Declaratively using <a href="https://github.com/aweber/rabbitmq-autocluster/">rabbitmq-autocluster</a> (a plugin)</li>
              <li>Manually with <code>rabbitmqctl</code></li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Please refer to the <a href="/autoclustering.html">Cluster Formation guide</a> for details.
          </p>

          <p>
            The composition of a cluster can be altered dynamically.
            All RabbitMQ brokers start out as running on a single
            node. These nodes can be joined into clusters, and
            subsequently turned back into individual brokers again.

        <doc:subsection name="overview-dealing-with-failure">
          <doc:heading>Failure Handling</doc:heading>

          <p>
            RabbitMQ brokers tolerate the failure of individual
            nodes. Nodes can be started and stopped at will,
            as long as they can contact a cluster member node
            known at the time of shutdown.
          </p>
          <p>
            RabbitMQ clustering has several modes of dealing with <a href="partitions.html">network partitions</a>,
            primarily consistency oriented. Clustering is meant to be used across LAN. It is
            not recommended to run clusters that span WAN.
            The <a href="shovel.html">Shovel</a> or
            <a href="federation.html">Federation</a>
            plugins are better solutions for connecting brokers across a
            WAN. Note that <a href="distributed.html">Shovel and Federation are not equivalent to clustering</a>.

          <doc:heading>Disk and RAM Nodes</doc:heading>

          <p>
            A node can be a <em>disk node</em> or a <em>RAM node</em>.
            (<b>Note:</b> <i>disk</i> and <i>disc</i> are used
            interchangeably). RAM nodes store internal database tables
            in RAM. This does not include messages, message store
            indices, queue indices and other node state.
          </p>

          <p>
            In well over 90% of cases you want all your nodes to be
            disk nodes; RAM nodes are a special case that can be used
            to improve the performance clusters with high queue,
            exchange, or binding churn. RAM nodes do not provide
            meaningfully higher message rates.  When in doubt, use
            disk nodes only.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since RAM nodes store internal database tables in RAM only, they must sync
            them from a peer node on startup. This means that a cluster must contain
            at least one disk node. It is therefore not possible to manually remove
            the last remaining disk node in a cluster.

        <p>
          The following is a transcript of setting up and manipulating
          a RabbitMQ cluster across three machines -
          <code>rabbit1</code>, <code>rabbit2</code>,
          <code>rabbit3</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We assume that the user is logged into all three machines,
          that RabbitMQ has been installed on the machines, and that
          the rabbitmq-server and rabbitmqctl scripts are in the
          user's PATH.
        </p>

          <doc:heading>Starting independent nodes</doc:heading>
          <p>
            Clusters are set up by re-configuring existing RabbitMQ
            nodes into a cluster configuration. Hence the first step
            is to start RabbitMQ on all nodes in the normal way:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">
rabbit1$ <i>rabbitmq-server -detached</i>
rabbit2$ <i>rabbitmq-server -detached</i>
rabbit3$ <i>rabbitmq-server -detached</i></pre>
          <p>
            This creates three <i>independent</i> RabbitMQ brokers,
            one on each node, as confirmed by the <i>cluster_status</i>
            command:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">
rabbit1$ <i>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</i>
Cluster status of node rabbit@rabbit1 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@rabbit1]}]},{running_nodes,[rabbit@rabbit1]}]
...done.
rabbit2$ <i>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</i>
Cluster status of node rabbit@rabbit2 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@rabbit2]}]},{running_nodes,[rabbit@rabbit2]}]
...done.
rabbit3$ <i>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</i>
Cluster status of node rabbit@rabbit3 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@rabbit3]}]},{running_nodes,[rabbit@rabbit3]}]
...done.</pre>

          <p>
            The node name of a RabbitMQ broker started from the
            <code>rabbitmq-server</code> shell script is
            <code>rabbit@<i>shorthostname</i></code>, where the short
            node name is lower-case (as in <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code>,
            above). If you use the <code>rabbitmq-server.bat</code>
            batch file on Windows, the short node name is upper-case (as
            in <code>rabbit@RABBIT1</code>). When you type node names,
            case matters, and these strings must match exactly.
          </p>
        </doc:subsection>

        <doc:subsection name="creating">
          <doc:heading>Creating the cluster</doc:heading>
          <p>
            In order to link up our three nodes in a cluster, we tell
            two of the nodes, say <code>rabbit@rabbit2</code> and
            <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code>, to join the cluster of the
            third, say <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We first join <code>rabbit@rabbit2</code> in a cluster
            with <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code>. To do that, on
            <code>rabbit@rabbit2</code> we stop the RabbitMQ
            application and join the <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code>
            cluster, then restart the RabbitMQ application. Note that
            joining a cluster implicitly resets the node, thus
            removing all resources and data that were previously
            present on that node.

          <p>
            We can see that the two nodes are joined in a cluster by
            running the <i>cluster_status</i> command on either of the nodes:

</pre>
          <p>
            Now we join <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code> to the same
            cluster. The steps are identical to the ones above, except
            this time we'll cluster to <code>rabbit2</code> to
            demonstrate that the node chosen to cluster to does not
            matter - it is enough to provide one online node and the
            node will be clustered to the cluster that the specified
            node belongs to.

          <p>
            Nodes that have been joined to a cluster can be stopped at
            any time. It is also ok for them to crash. In both cases
            the rest of the cluster continues operating unaffected,
            and the nodes automatically "catch up" with the other
            cluster nodes when they start up again.
          </p>
          <p>
            We shut down the nodes <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code> and
            <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code> and check on the cluster

            There are some important caveats:

          <ul>
            <li>
              When the entire cluster is brought down, the last node to go down
              must be the first node to be brought online. If this doesn't
              happen, the nodes will wait 30 seconds for the last disc node to
              come back online, and fail afterwards.  If the last node to go
              offline cannot be brought back up, it can be removed from the
              cluster using the <code>forget_cluster_node</code> command -
              consult the <code>rabbitmqctl</code> manpage for more information.
            </li>
            <li>
              If all cluster nodes stop in a simultaneous and
              uncontrolled manner (for example with a power cut) you
              can be left with a situation in which all nodes think
              that some other node stopped after them. In this case
              you can use the <code>force_boot</code> command on one
              node to make it bootable again - consult the
              <code>rabbitmqctl</code> manpage for more information.

            Nodes need to be removed explicitly from a cluster when they are no

            <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code> from the cluster, returning it to
            independent operation. To do that, on <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code> we
            stop the RabbitMQ application, reset the node, and restart the
            RabbitMQ application.

            The <i>cluster_status</i> command now shows all three nodes

          <pre class="sourcecode">

          <p>
            Note that <code>rabbit@rabbit2</code> retains the residual
            state of the cluster, whereas <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code>
            and <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code> are freshly initialised
            RabbitMQ brokers. If we want to re-initialise
            <code>rabbit@rabbit2</code> we follow the same steps as
            for the other nodes:

      <doc:section name="upgrading">
          <doc:heading>Upgrading clusters</doc:heading>
          <p>
            When upgrading from one major or minor version of RabbitMQ
            to another (i.e. from 3.0.x to 3.1.x, or from 2.x.x to
            3.x.x), or when upgrading Erlang, the whole cluster must
            be taken down for the upgrade (since clusters cannot run
            mixed versions like this). This will generally not be the
            case when upgrading from one patch version to another (i.e.
            from 3.0.x to 3.0.y), except when indicated otherwise in
            the release notes; these versions can be mixed in a cluster.
            Therefore, it is strongly recommended to consult release
            notes before upgrading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some patch releases known to require a cluster-wide
            restart:

            <ul>
              <li>3.0.0 cannot be mixed with later
                  versions from the 3.0.x series</li>
              <li>3.6.6 and later cannot
                  be mixed with earlier versions from the 3.6.x series</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            RabbitMQ will automatically update its persistent data
            structures if necessary when upgrading between major /
            minor versions. In a cluster, this task is performed by
            the first disc node to be started (the "upgrader"
            node). Therefore when upgrading a RabbitMQ cluster, you
            should not attempt to start any RAM nodes first; any RAM
            nodes started will emit an error message and fail to start
            up.
          </p>
          <p>
            While not strictly necessary, it is a good idea to decide
            ahead of time which disc node will be the upgrader, stop
            that node last, and start it first. Otherwise changes to
            the cluster configuration that were made between the
            upgrader node stopping and the last node stopping will be
            lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Automatic upgrades are only possible from RabbitMQ
            versions 2.1.1 and later. If you have an earlier cluster,
            you will need to rebuild it to upgrade.
          </p>

          <doc:heading>A Cluster on a Single Machine</doc:heading>
          <p>
            Under some circumstances it can be useful to run a cluster
            of RabbitMQ nodes on a single machine. This would
            typically be useful for experimenting with clustering on a
            desktop or laptop without the overhead of starting several
            virtual machines for the cluster.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to run multiple RabbitMQ nodes on a single
            machine, it is necessary to make sure the nodes have
            distinct node names, data store locations, log file
            locations, and bind to different ports, including those
            used by plugins. See <code>RABBITMQ_NODENAME</code>,
            <code>RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT</code>, and
            <code>RABBITMQ_DIST_PORT</code> in the <a
            href="/configure.html#define-environment-variables">Configuration
            guide</a>, as well as <code>RABBITMQ_MNESIA_DIR</code>,
            <code>RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILE</code>, and
            <code>RABBITMQ_LOG_BASE</code> in the <a
            href="/relocate.html">File and Directory Locations
            guide</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can start multiple nodes on the same host manually by
            repeated invocation of <code>rabbitmq-server</code> (
            <code>rabbitmq-server.bat</code> on Windows). For example:
          </p>
          <pre class="example">
$ RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT=5672 RABBITMQ_NODENAME=rabbit rabbitmq-server -detached
$ RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT=5673 RABBITMQ_NODENAME=hare rabbitmq-server -detached
$ rabbitmqctl -n hare stop_app
$ rabbitmqctl -n hare join_cluster rabbit@`hostname -s`
$ rabbitmqctl -n hare start_app</pre>
          <p>
            will set up a two node cluster, both nodes as disc nodes.
            Note that if you have RabbitMQ opening any ports other
            than AMQP, you'll need to configure those not to clash as
            well. This can be done via command line:
          </p>
          <pre class="example">
$ RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT=5672 RABBITMQ_SERVER_START_ARGS="-rabbitmq_management listener [{port,15672}]" RABBITMQ_NODENAME=rabbit rabbitmq-server -detached
$ RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT=5673 RABBITMQ_SERVER_START_ARGS="-rabbitmq_management listener [{port,15673}]" RABBITMQ_NODENAME=hare rabbitmq-server -detached</pre>
          <p>
            will start two nodes (which can then be clustered) when
            the management plugin is installed.

      <doc:section name="clients">
        <doc:heading>Connecting to Clusters from Clients</doc:heading>
        <p>
          A client can connect as normal to any node within a
          cluster. If that node should fail, and the rest of the
          cluster survives, then the client should notice the closed
          connection, and should be able to reconnect to some
          surviving member of the cluster. Generally, it's not
          advisable to bake in node hostnames or IP addresses into
          client applications: this introduces inflexibility and will
          require client applications to be edited, recompiled and
          redeployed should the configuration of the cluster change or
          the number of nodes in the cluster change. Instead, we
          recommend a more abstracted approach: this could be a
          dynamic DNS service which has a very short TTL
          configuration, or a plain TCP load balancer, or some sort of
          mobile IP achieved with pacemaker or similar
          technologies. In general, this aspect of managing the
          connection to nodes within a cluster is beyond the scope of
          RabbitMQ itself, and we recommend the use of other
          technologies designed specifically to solve these problems.

      <doc:section name="ram-nodes">
        <doc:heading>Clusters with RAM nodes</doc:heading>
        <p>
          RAM nodes keep their metadata only in memory. As RAM nodes
          don't have to write to disc as much as disc nodes, they can
          perform better. However, note that since persistent queue
          data is always stored on disc, the performance improvements
          will affect only resource management (e.g. adding/removing
          queues, exchanges, or vhosts), but not publishing or
          consuming speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          RAM nodes are an advanced use case; when setting up your
          first cluster you should simply not use them. You should
          have enough disc nodes to handle your redundancy
          requirements, then if necessary add additional RAM nodes for
          scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cluster containing only RAM nodes is fragile; if the
          cluster stops you will not be able to start it again and
          <b>will lose all data</b>. RabbitMQ will prevent the creation of a
          RAM-node-only cluster in many situations, but it can't
          absolutely prevent it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The examples here show a cluster with one disc and one RAM
          node for simplicity only; such a cluster is a poor design
          choice.

            We can declare a node as a RAM node when it first joins
            the cluster. We do this with <code>rabbitmqctl

          <p>
            We can change the type of a node from ram to disc and vice
            versa. Say we wanted to reverse the types of
            <code>rabbit@rabbit2</code> and <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code>, turning
            the former from a ram node into a disc node and the latter from a
            disc node into a ram node. To do that we can use the
            <code>change_cluster_node_type</code> command. The node must be
            stopped first.

        <p>
          A RabbitMQ <i>broker</i> is a logical grouping of one or
          several Erlang <i>nodes</i>, each running the RabbitMQ
          <i>application</i> and sharing users, virtual hosts,
          queues, exchanges, etc. Sometimes we refer to the collection
          of nodes as a <i>cluster</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All data/state required for the operation of a RabbitMQ
          broker is replicated across all nodes, for reliability and
          scaling, with full ACID properties. An exception to this are
          message queues, which by default reside on the node that
          created them, though they are visible and reachable from all
          nodes. To replicate queues across nodes in a cluster, see
          the documentation on <a href="ha.html">high availability</a>
          (note that you will need a working cluster first).
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="partitions.html">RabbitMQ clustering does not
          tolerate network partitions well</a>, so it should not be
          used over a WAN.
          The <a href="plugins.html#rabbitmq_shovel">shovel</a> or
          <a href="federation.html">federation</a>
          plugins are better solutions for connecting brokers across a
          WAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          The composition of a cluster can be altered dynamically.
          All RabbitMQ brokers start out as running on a single
          node. These nodes can be joined into clusters, and
          subsequently turned back into individual brokers again.
        </p>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ brokers tolerate the failure of individual
          nodes. Nodes can be started and stopped at will.
        </p>
        <p>
          A node can be a <em>disk node</em> or a <em>RAM node</em>.
          (<b>Note:</b> <i>disk</i> and <i>disc</i> are used interchangeably.
          Configuration syntax or status messages normally use <i>disc</i>.)
          RAM nodes keep their state only in memory (with the exception of queue
          contents, which can reside on disc if the queue is persistent or too
          big to fit in memory). Disk nodes keep state in memory and on disk. As
          RAM nodes don't have to write to disk as much as disk nodes, they can
          perform better. However, note that since the queue data is always
          stored on disc, the performance improvements will affect only
          resources management (e.g. adding/removing queues, exchanges, or
          vhosts), but not publishing or consuming speed. Because state is
          replicated across all nodes in the cluster, it is sufficient (but not
          recommended) to have just one disk node within a cluster, to store the
          state of the cluster safely.

          The following is a transcript of setting up and manipulating
          a RabbitMQ cluster across three machines -
          <code>rabbit1</code>, <code>rabbit2</code>,
          <code>rabbit3</code>, with two of the machines replicating
          data on ram and disk, and the other replicating data in ram
          only.
        </p>
        <p>
          We assume that the user is logged into all three machines,
          that RabbitMQ has been installed on the machines, and that
          the rabbitmq-server and rabbitmqctl scripts are in the
          user's PATH.
        </p>

          <doc:heading>Initial setup</doc:heading>
          <p>
            Erlang nodes use a cookie to determine whether they are
            allowed to communicate with each other - for two nodes to
            be able to communicate they must have the same cookie.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cookie is just a string of alphanumeric characters. It
            can be as long or short as you like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Erlang will automatically create a random cookie file when
            the RabbitMQ server starts up. This will be typically
            located in <code>/var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie</code>
            on Unix systems and <code>C:\Users\<i>Current
            User</i>\.erlang.cookie</code> or <code>C:\Documents and
            Settings\<i>Current User</i>\.erlang.cookie</code> on
            Windows systems. The easiest way to proceed is to allow
            one node to create the file, and then copy it to all the
            other nodes in the cluster.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an alternative, you can insert the option "<code>-setcookie
            <i>cookie</i></code>" in the <code>erl</code> call in the
            <code>rabbitmq-server</code> and <code>rabbitmqctl</code>
            scripts.

          <p>
            Clusters are set up by re-configuring existing RabbitMQ
            nodes into a cluster configuration. Hence the first step
            is to start RabbitMQ on all nodes in the normal way:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">
rabbit1$ <i>rabbitmq-server -detached</i>
rabbit2$ <i>rabbitmq-server -detached</i>
rabbit3$ <i>rabbitmq-server -detached</i></pre>
          <p>
            This creates three <i>independent</i> RabbitMQ brokers,
            one on each node, as confirmed by the <i>cluster_status</i>
            command:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">
rabbit1$ <i>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</i>
Cluster status of node rabbit@rabbit1 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@rabbit1]}]},{running_nodes,[rabbit@rabbit1]}]
...done.
rabbit2$ <i>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</i>
Cluster status of node rabbit@rabbit2 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@rabbit2]}]},{running_nodes,[rabbit@rabbit2]}]
...done.
rabbit3$ <i>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</i>
Cluster status of node rabbit@rabbit3 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@rabbit3]}]},{running_nodes,[rabbit@rabbit3]}]
...done.</pre>

          <p>
            The node name of a RabbitMQ broker started from the
            <code>rabbitmq-server</code> shell script is
            <code>rabbit@<i>shorthostname</i></code>, where the short
            node name is lower-case (as in <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code>,
            above). If you use the <code>rabbitmq-server.bat</code>
            batch file on Windows, the short node name is upper-case (as
            in <code>rabbit@RABBIT1</code>). When you type node names,
            case matters, and these strings must match exactly.
          </p>

        <doc:subsection name="creating">
          <doc:heading>Creating the cluster</doc:heading>
          <p>
            In order to link up our three nodes in a cluster, we tell
            two of the nodes, say <code>rabbit@rabbit2</code> and
            <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code>, to join the cluster of the
            third, say <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We first join <code>rabbit@rabbit2</code> as a ram node in a cluster
            with <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code> in a cluster. To do that, on
            <code>rabbit@rabbit2</code> we stop the RabbitMQ application and
            join the <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code> cluster enabling the
            <code>--ram</code> flag, and restart the RabbitMQ application. Note
            that joining a cluster implicitly resets the node, thus removing all
            resources and data that were previously present on that node.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can see that the two nodes are joined in a cluster by
            running the <i>cluster_status</i> command on either of the nodes:

</pre>
          <p>
            Now we join <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code> as a disk node to the same
            cluster. The steps are identical to the ones above, except that we
            omit the <code>--ram</code> flag in order to turn it into a disk
            rather than ram node. This time we'll cluster to
            <code>rabbit2</code> to demonstrate that the node chosen to cluster
            to does not matter - it is enough to provide one online node and the
            node will be clustered to the cluster that the specified node
            belongs to.

          <p>
            We can change the type of a node from ram to disk and vice
            versa. Say we wanted to reverse the types of
            <code>rabbit@rabbit2</code> and <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code>, turning
            the former from a ram node into a disk node and the latter from a
            disk node into a ram node. To do that we can use the
            <code>change_cluster_node_type</code> command. The node must be
            stopped first.

            Nodes that have been joined to a cluster can be stopped at
            any time. It is also ok for them to crash. In both cases
            the rest of the cluster continues operating unaffected,
            and the nodes automatically "catch up" with the other
            cluster nodes when they start up again.
          </p>
          <p>
            We shut down the nodes <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code> and

            There are some important caveats:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              At least one disk node should be running at all times to prevent
              data loss.  RabbitMQ will prevent the creation of a RAM-only
              cluster in many situations, but it still won't stop you from
              stopping and forcefully resetting all the disc nodes, which will
              lead to a RAM-only cluster. Doing this is not advisable and makes
              losing data very easy.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the entire cluster is brought down, the last node to go down
              must be the first node to be brought online. If this doesn't
              happen, the nodes will wait 30 seconds for the last disc node to
              come back online, and fail afterwards.  If the last node to go
              offline cannot be brought back up, it can be removed from the
              cluster using the <code>forget_cluster_node</code> command -
              consult the <code>rabbitmqctl</code> manpage for more information.

            Nodes need to be removed explicitly from a cluster when they are no
            longer meant to be part of it. We first remove
            <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code> from the cluster, returning it to
            independent operation. To do that, on <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code> we
            stop the RabbitMQ application, reset the node, and restart the
            RabbitMQ application.

            Instead of configuring clusters "on the fly" using the
            <code>cluster</code> command, clusters can also be set up
            via the <a
            href="configure.html#configuration-file">RabbitMQ
            configuration file</a>. The file should set the
            <code>cluster_nodes</code> field in the rabbit application
            to a tuple contanining a list of rabbit nodes, and an atom
            - either <code>disc</code> or <code>ram</code> -
            indicating whether the node should join them as a disc
            node or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <code>cluster_nodes</code> is specified, RabbitMQ will try to
            cluster to each node provided, and stop after it can cluster with
            one of them. RabbitMQ will try cluster to any node which is online
            that has the same version of Erlang and RabbitMQ. If no suitable
            nodes are found, the node is left unclustered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that the cluster configuration is applied only to fresh
            nodes. A fresh nodes is a node which has just been reset or is
            being start for the first time. Thus, the automatic clustering won't
            take place after restarts of nodes. This means that any change to
            the clustering via <code>rabbitmqctl</code> will take precedence
            over the automatic clustering configuration.
          </p>
          <p>
            A common use of cluster configuration via the RabbitMQ config file
            is to automatically configure nodes to join a common cluster. For
            this purpose the same cluster nodes can be specified on all cluster,
            plus the boolean to determine disc nodes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Say we want to join our three separate nodes of our running example
            back into a single cluster, with <code>rabbit@rabbit1</code> and
            <code>rabbit@rabbit2</code> being the disk nodes of the
            cluster. First we reset and stop all nodes, to make sure that we're
            working with fresh nodes:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">
rabbit1$ <i>rabbitmqctl stop_app</i>
Stopping node rabbit@rabbit1 ...done.
rabbit1$ <i>rabbitmqctl reset</i>
Resetting node rabbit@rabbit1 ...done.
rabbit1$ <i>rabbitmqctl stop</i>
Stopping and halting node rabbit@rabbit1 ...done.
rabbit2$ <i>rabbitmqctl stop_app</i>
Stopping node rabbit@rabbit2 ...done.
rabbit2$ <i>rabbitmqctl reset</i>
Resetting node rabbit@rabbit2 ...done.
rabbit2$ <i>rabbitmqctl stop</i>
Stopping and halting node rabbit@rabbit2 ...done.
rabbit3$ <i>rabbitmqctl stop_app</i>
Stopping node rabbit@rabbit3 ...done.
rabbit3$ <i>rabbitmqctl reset</i>
Resetting node rabbit@rabbit3 ...done.
rabbit3$ <i>rabbitmqctl stop</i>
Stopping and halting node rabbit@rabbit3 ...done.</pre>
          <p>
            Now we set the relevant field in the config file:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">[
  ...
  {rabbit, [
        ...
        {cluster_nodes, {['rabbit@rabbit1', 'rabbit@rabbit2', 'rabbit@rabbit3'], disc}},
        ...
  ]},
  ...
].</pre>
          <p>
            For instance, if this were the only field we needed to set, we would simply create the RabbitMQ config file with the contents:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">[{rabbit,
  [{cluster_nodes, {['rabbit@rabbit1', 'rabbit@rabbit2', 'rabbit@rabbit3'], disc}}]}].</pre>
          <p>
            Since we want <code>rabbit@rabbit3</code> to be a ram node, we need
            to specify that in its configuration file:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">[{rabbit,
  [{cluster_nodes, {['rabbit@rabbit1', 'rabbit@rabbit2', 'rabbit@rabbit3'], ram}}]}].</pre>
          <p>
            (Note for Erlang programmers and the curious: this is a
            standard Erlang configuration file.  For more details, see the
            <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">configuration guide</a>
            and the
            <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/config.html">Erlang Config Man Page</a>.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we have the configuration files in place, we simply start the
            nodes:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">
rabbit1$ <i>rabbitmq-server -detached</i>
rabbit2$ <i>rabbitmq-server -detached</i>
rabbit3$ <i>rabbitmq-server -detached</i></pre>
          <p>
            We can see that the three nodes are joined in a cluster by
            running the <i>cluster_status</i> command on any of the nodes:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">
rabbit1$ <i>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</i>
Cluster status of node rabbit@rabbit1 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@rabbit1,rabbit@rabbit2]},{ram,[rabbit@rabbit3]}]},
 {running_nodes,[rabbit@rabbit1,rabbit@rabbit2,rabbit@rabbit3]}]
...done.
rabbit2$ <i>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</i>
Cluster status of node rabbit@rabbit2 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@rabbit1,rabbit@rabbit2]},{ram,[rabbit@rabbit3]}]},
 {running_nodes,[rabbit@rabbit1,rabbit@rabbit2,rabbit@rabbit3]}]
...done.
rabbit3$ <i>rabbitmqctl cluster_status</i>
Cluster status of node rabbit@rabbit3 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@rabbit1,rabbit@rabbit2]},{ram,[rabbit@rabbit3]}]},
 {running_nodes,[rabbit@rabbit1,rabbit@rabbit2,rabbit@rabbit3]}]
...done.</pre>
        <p>
          Note that, in order to remove a node from an auto-configured
          cluster, it must first be removed from the rabbitmq.config
          files of the other nodes in the cluster.  Only then, can it
          be reset safely.

      <doc:section name="upgrading">
          <doc:heading>Upgrading clusters</doc:heading>
          <p>
            When upgrading from one major or minor version of RabbitMQ
            to another (i.e. from 3.0.x to 3.1.x, or from 2.x.x to
            3.x.x), or when upgrading Erlang, the whole cluster must
            be taken down for the upgrade (since clusters cannot run
            mixed versions like this). This will not be the case when
            upgrading from one patch version to another (i.e. from
            3.0.x to 3.0.y); these versions can be mixed in a cluster
            (with the exception that 3.0.0 cannot be mixed with later
            versions from the 3.0.x series).
          </p>
          <p>
            RabbitMQ will automatically update its persistent data
            structures if necessary when upgrading between major /
            minor versions. In a cluster, this task is performed by
            the first disc node to be started (the "upgrader"
            node). Therefore when upgrading a RabbitMQ cluster, you
            should not attempt to start any RAM nodes first; any RAM
            nodes started will emit an error message and fail to start
            up.
          </p>
          <p>
            While not strictly necessary, it is a good idea to decide
            ahead of time which disc node will be the upgrader, stop
            that node last, and start it first. Otherwise changes to
            the cluster configuration that were made between the
            upgrader node stopping and the last node stopping will be
            lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Automatic upgrades are only possible from RabbitMQ
            versions 2.1.1 and later. If you have an earlier cluster,
            you will need to rebuild it to upgrade.
          </p>

      <doc:section name="single-machine">
          <doc:heading>A cluster on a single machine</doc:heading>
          <p>
            Under some circumstances it can be useful to run a cluster
            of RabbitMQ nodes on a single machine. This would
            typically be useful for experimenting with clustering on a
            desktop or laptop without the overhead of starting several
            virtual machines for the cluster. The two main
            requirements for running more than one node on a single
            machine are that each node should have a unique name and
            bind to a unique port / IP address combination for each
            protocol in use.
          </p>
          <p>
	    You can start multiple nodes on the same host
	    manually by repeated invocation of
	    <code>rabbitmq-server</code> (
	    <code>rabbitmq-server.bat</code> on Windows). You must
	    ensure that for each invocation you set the environment
	    variables <code>RABBITMQ_NODENAME</code> and
	    <code>RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT</code> to suitable values.
          </p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">
$ RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT=5672 RABBITMQ_NODENAME=rabbit rabbitmq-server -detached
$ RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT=5673 RABBITMQ_NODENAME=hare rabbitmq-server -detached
$ rabbitmqctl -n hare stop_app
$ rabbitmqctl -n hare join_cluster rabbit@`hostname -s`
$ rabbitmqctl -n hare start_app</pre>
          <p>
            will set up a two node cluster with one disc node and one
            ram node. Note that if you have RabbitMQ opening any ports
            other than AMQP, you'll need to configure those
            not to clash as well - for example:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">
$ RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT=5672 RABBITMQ_SERVER_START_ARGS="-rabbitmq_management listener [{port,15672}]" RABBITMQ_NODENAME=rabbit rabbitmq-server -detached
$ RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT=5673 RABBITMQ_SERVER_START_ARGS="-rabbitmq_management listener [{port,15673}]" RABBITMQ_NODENAME=hare rabbitmq-server -detached</pre>
          <p>
            will start two nodes (which can then be clustered) when
            the management plugin is installed.
          </p>
      </doc:section>
      <doc:section name="firewall">
          <doc:heading>Firewalled nodes</doc:heading>
          <p>
            The case for firewalled clustered nodes exists when nodes
            are in a data center or on a reliable network, but separated
            by firewalls. Again, clustering is not recommended over a WAN or
            when network links between nodes are unreliable.
          </p>
          <p>
            If different nodes of a cluster are in the same data center,
            but behind firewalls then additional configuration will be
            necessary to ensure inter-node communication. Erlang makes
            use of a Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) for resolution of node
            names in a cluster. Nodes must be able to reach each other
            and the port mapper daemon for clustering to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The default epmd port is 4369, but this can be changed
            using the <span class="envvar">ERL_EPMD_PORT</span>
            environment variable. All nodes must use the same port.
            Firewalls must permit traffic on this port to pass between
            clustered nodes. For further details see the
            <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/epmd.html">Erlang epmd
            manpage</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a distributed Erlang node address has been resolved via epmd,
            other nodes will attempt to communicate directly with that address
            using the Erlang distributed node protocol. The port range for this
            communication can be configured with two parameters for the Erlang
            kernel application:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>inet_dist_listen_min</li>
            <li>inet_dist_listen_max</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Firewalls must permit traffic in this range to pass between
            clustered nodes (assuming all nodes use the same port range).
            The default port range is unrestricted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/kernel_app.html">
            Erlang kernel_app manpage</a> contains more details on the
            port range that distributed Erlang nodes listen on.
            See the <a href="configure.html">configuration</a> page
            for information on how to create and edit a configuration
            file.

      <doc:section name="clients">
        <doc:heading>Connecting to Clusters from Clients</doc:heading>
        <p>
          A client can connect as normal to any node within a
          cluster. If that node should fail, and the rest of the
          cluster survives, then the client should notice the closed
          connection, and should be able to reconnect to some
          surviving member of the cluster. Generally, it's not
          advisable to bake in node hostnames or IP addresses into
          client applications: this introduces inflexibility and will
          require client applications to be edited, recompiled and
          redeployed should the configuration of the cluster change or
          the number of nodes in the cluster change. Instead, we
          recommend a more abstracted approach: this could be a
          dynamic DNS service which has a very short TTL
          configuration, or a plain TCP load balancer, or some sort of
          mobile IP achieved with pacemaker or similar
          technologies. In general, this aspect of managing the
          connection to nodes within a cluster is beyond the scope of
          RabbitMQ itself, and we recommend the use of other
          technologies designed specifically to solve these problems.

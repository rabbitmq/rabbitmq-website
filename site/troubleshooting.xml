          <dt><strong>Checking Broker Status</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              You can use <code>rabbitmqctl status</code>
              to verify whether a broker is running.<br />
              Normal output from a running broker without plugins follows this pattern:
              <pre>
  Status of node 'rabbit@xxx' ...
  [{pid,...},
   {running_applications,[{rabbit,"RabbitMQ","&version-server;"},
                          {os_mon,"..."},
                          {sasl,"..."},
                          {mnesia,"..."},
                          {stdlib,"..."},
                          {kernel,"..."},
  {os,"..."},
  {erlang_version,"..."},
  {memory,"..."}}]</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              This example indicates that no broker is running:
              <pre>
  Status of node 'rabbit@xxx' ...
  Error: unable to connect to node 'rabbit@xxx': nodedown
  diagnostics:
  - nodes and their ports on xxx: [{rabbitmqctl,...}]
  - current node: 'rabbitmqctlxxx@xxx'
  - current node home dir: [...]
  - current node cookie hash: [...]</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              If the diagnostic line looks like this:
              <pre>
  - nodes and their ports on xxx: [{rabbit,...},{rabbitmqctl,...}]</pre>
  and the <a href="relocate.html">broker log file</a> contains entries
  similar to
              <pre>
  Connection attempt from disallowed node...</pre> then you should
  make sure the <a href="clustering.html#setup">erlang cookies</a> are
  the same, e.g. by checking that the cookie hash displayed in the
  diagnostics is the same as that shown by the broker when it starts
  up.
            </p>
            <p>
              A common reason for cookie mismatches when invoking
              rabbitmqctl against a broker on the same host is that
              broker and rabbitmqctl were run as different
              user. Evidence of this comes in the form of a mismatch
              in the node home dir shown by the broker on startup vs
              what is displayed in the rabbitmqctl diagnostics.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the absence of the "
              <code>Connection attempt from disallowed node...</code>" log entry, check that the
              Erlang distribution port on which the broker is
              listening is not blocked by a <a
              href="clustering.html#firewall">firewall</a>. The port
              is shown in the <code>{rabbit,...}</code> part of the
              "<code>nodes and their ports...</code>" diagnostics
              line. Try connecting to it with e.g. telnet.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the "<code>nodes and their ports...</code>" line
              contains no entry for rabbit then the broker probably
              isn't running. Check the broker logs for errors.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt><strong>Server Fails to Start</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              When the server fails to start, usually a crash dump file
              <code>erl_crash.dump</code> is created in the directory
              where the server was started. This can provide very detailed
              information on the causes of a start up failure, but its
              analysis requires Erlang expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
          If you attempt to start another server while a broker is already running,
          then you will receive an error report.
          You can confirm whether the broker is already running by checking the status.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the server fails to start, examine the console output and
              the log files in the <b>RABBITMQ_LOG_BASE</b> directory.
              Configuration and permission errors are frequently the cause, e.g. the
              Mnesia directory cannot be created.

          <dt><strong>Windows Service fails to Install</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            If the service fails to install, check the service account has full access permission for
            <b>RABBITMQ_BASE</b>, <b>RABBITMQ_MNESIA_BASE</b> and
            <b>RABBITMQ_LOG_BASE</b> directories
            [<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/security/learnmore/accesscontrol.mspx">XP</a>,

          <dt><strong>Windows Service fails to Start</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            If the service fails to start, make sure the service has been
            installed.
            </p>
            <p>
                On starting the service, if the service output reads "
                <code>The process terminated unexpectedly</code>" instead, then the
                service did not start correctly. Check that the
                environment variables are set correctly. The logfiles in
                <code>RABBITMQ_BASE</code> may also contain useful diagnostic
                information.
            </p>
            <p>
              If <code>RABBITMQ_BASE</code> path contains non-ASCII characters, RabbitMQ service may fail to start
              with the error "<code>RabbitMQ: Erlang machine stopped instantly (distribution name conflict?)</code>". If this is the case,
              override <code>RABBITMQ_BASE</code> to point to a directory that only has ASCII characters and <em>re-install</em> the service
              (restarting will not be sufficient).

          <dd>
            <p>
            The solution is to uninstall RabbitMQ and Erlang.
            Then remove all registry keys under <code>HKLM/SOFTWARE/Ericsson/Erlang/ErlSrv</code>,
            and then install Erlang and RabbitMQ (in that order).

          <dt><strong>Client Connection Takes a Long Time</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Client connections generally should not take more than a second
              on networks with reasonable latency. If it takes 10 or more seconds
              for a client to connect to RabbitMQ, this typically suggests a DNS resolution timeout.
              This is often the case with environements that use VPN, which may alter DNS servers
              configuration silently.

        <p>
          If the server is not behaving as expected during operation,
          examine the log files and use the <code>rabbitmqctl</code>
          commands from the <a href="admin-guide.html">admin guide</a>
          to obtain further information on the server status.

          the <a href="api-guide.html#tracer">RabbitMQ capture and analysis
          tool</a> may help in the analysis.

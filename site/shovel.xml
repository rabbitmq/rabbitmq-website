    <title>Shovel plugin</title>
  </head>
  <body show-in-this-page="true">
    <p>
      The <em>Shovel plugin</em> allows you to configure a number of
      <em>shovel</em>s, which start automatically when the broker
      starts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high level goal of a <em>shovel</em> is to reliably and
      continually take messages from a queue (a <em>source</em>) in one
      broker and publish them to exchanges in another broker (a
      <em>destination</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The source queue and destination exchanges can be on the same
      broker or distinct brokers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shovel behaves like a well-written client application, which
      connects to its source and destination, reads and writes messages,
      and copes with connection failures.
    </p>

    <p>
      The primary advantages of a shovel are:
    </p>
    <dl class="plain">
      <dt><strong>Loose coupling</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        A shovel can move messages between brokers (or clusters) in
        different administrative domains:
        <ul class="plain">
          <li>
            they may have different users and virtual hosts;
          </li>
          <li>
            they may run on different versions of RabbitMQ and Erlang.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>WAN-friendly</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        The Shovel plugin uses AMQP to communicate between brokers, and
        is designed to tolerate intermittent connectivity without
        message loss.
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Highly tailorable</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        When a shovel connects (either to the source or the
        destination) it can be configured to perform any number of
        explicit methods. For example, the source queue need not exist
        initially, and can be <em>declared</em> on connect.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      A comparison between <em>clustering</em>, <em>federated
      exchanges</em> and <em>shovels</em> is given on the
      <a href="distributed.html">Distributed Messaging</a> page.
    </p>

    <doc:section name="what-it-do">
      <doc:heading>What does it do?</doc:heading>
      <p>
        The Shovel plugin defines (and runs) an Erlang client
        application for each shovel.
      </p>
      <p>
        In essence, a shovel is a simple pump. Each shovel:
        <ul class="plain">
          <li>
            <strong><em>connects</em></strong> to the source broker and
            the destination broker,
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><em>consumes</em></strong> messages from the queue,
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><em>re-publishes</em></strong> each message to the
            destination broker (using, by default, the original exchange
            name and routing_key).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The shovel configuration allows each of these processes to be
        tailored.
      </p>
      <dl class="plain">
        <dt><strong><em>connects</em></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            After connection to a source or a destination broker a
            series of configured AMQP <em>declarations</em> can be
            issued. Queues, exchanges and bindings can be declared.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dd>
          <p>
            A shovel will attempt to reconnect to a broker if a failure
            occurs and multiple brokers can be specified for the source and
            destination so that another broker may be selected (at
            random) to reconnect to. A reconnection delay can be
            specified to avoid flooding the network with reconnection
            attempts, or to prevent reconnection on failure altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            All configured <em>declarations</em> (for that source or
            destination) are re-issued upon re-connect.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><em>consumes</em></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The shovel's consumer can acknowledge messages
            automatically on receipt, after (re-)publication, or after
            confirmation of its publication.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><em>re-publishes</em></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Both the publish method and the message properties can be
            modified with explicit parameter values.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

    <doc:section name="getting-started">
      <doc:heading>Getting started</doc:heading>
      <p>
        The <em>Shovel plugin</em> is included in the RabbitMQ
        distribution. To enable it, use
        <a href="man/rabbitmq-plugins.1.man.html">rabbitmq-plugins</a>:
      </p>
<pre class="example">
  rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_shovel
</pre>
      <p>
        You may also wish to enable the
        <code>rabbitmq_shovel_management</code> plugin (see
        <a href="#management-status">below</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        There is no requirement to run the shovel on the same broker
        (or cluster) as its source or destination; the shovel can be
        entirely separate.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two distinct ways to define
        shovels: <a href="shovel-static.html">static shovels</a> and
        <a href="shovel-dynamic.html">dynamic shovels</a>. The
        differences are as follows:
      </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="shovel-static.html">Static Shovels</a></th>
        <th><a href="shovel-dynamic.html">Dynamic Shovels</a></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Defined in the broker <a href="configure.html">configuration file</a>.
        </td>
        <td>
          Defined in the broker's <a href="parameters.html">parameters</a>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Require a restart of the hosting broker to change.
        </td>
        <td>
          Can be created and deleted at any time.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Slightly more general: any queues, exchanges or bindings can
          be declared manually at startup.
        </td>
        <td>
          Slightly more opinionated: the queues, exchanges and
          bindings used by the shovel will be declared automatically.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="clustering">
      <doc:heading>Shovels between clusters</doc:heading>
      <p>
        It's normally desirable to ensure that shovels are resilient
        to failure of any node in the source or destination clusters,
        or the cluster hosting the shovel.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can ensure that shovels can fail over to different nodes
        in the source or destination clusters by specifying multiple
        source and/or destination URIs for each shovel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dynamic shovels are automatically defined on all nodes of the
        hosting cluster on which the shovel plugin is enabled. Each
        shovel will only start on one node (arbitrarily), but will
        fail over to another node if that one goes down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Static shovels should be defined in the configuration file for
        all nodes of the hosting cluster on which the shovel plugin is
        enabled. Again each shovel will only start on one node and
        fail over when needed.
      </p>
    </doc:section>

    <doc:section name="status">
      <doc:heading>Monitoring shovels</doc:heading>
      <p>
        There are two ways of discovering the status of shovels.
      </p>
      <doc:subsection name="management-status">
        <doc:heading>Use shovel management</doc:heading>
        <p>
          Shovel status can be reported on the
          <a href="management.html">Management plugin</a> user interface
          by enabling the <code>rabbitmq_shovel_management</code> plugin
          wherever you have the management plugin enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about configured shovels will automatically appear
          in the management API and UI.
        </p>
      </doc:subsection>

      <doc:subsection name="direct-status">
        <doc:heading>Direct query</doc:heading>
        <p>
          Shovel status can be obtained by direct query of the Shovel
          plugin app. Issue the following <code>rabbitmqctl</code>
          command:
        </p>
<pre class="example">
  $ rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_shovel_status:status().'
</pre>
        <p>
          This calls the <code>status</code> method in a module of the
          <code>rabbitmq_shovel</code> plugin, which will return an
          Erlang list, with one element for each configured shovel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each element of the list is a tuple with four fields:
          <code>{<em><strong>Name</strong></em>,
          <em><strong>Type</strong></em>,
          <em><strong>Status</strong></em>,
          <em><strong>Timestamp</strong></em>}</code>.
        </p>
        <sl>
          <li>
            <code><strong><em>Name</em></strong></code>
            is the shovel name,
          </li>
          <li>
            <code><strong><em>Type</em></strong></code>
            is either <code>static</code> or <code>dynamic</code>,
          </li>
          <li>
            <code><strong><em>Status</em></strong></code>
            is the current shovel state,
          </li>
          <li>
            and <code><strong><em>Timestamp</em></strong></code> is the
            time when the shovel <em>entered</em> this state.
          </li>
        </sl>
        <p>
          <code><strong><em>Timestamp</em></strong></code> is a local
          calendar time of the form
          <code>{{YYYY, MM, DD}, {HH, MM, SS}}</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code><strong><em>Status</em></strong></code> takes one of
          three forms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The shovel is starting up, connecting and creating
            resources:
<pre class="example">
  'starting'
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            The shovel is running normally:
<pre class="example">
  { 'running', {'source', <em>Source</em>},
               {'destination', <em>Destination</em>}}:
</pre>
            <p>
              where <code><em>Source</em></code> and
              <code><em>Destination</em></code> terms give the
              respective connection parameters.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            The shovel has terminated:
<pre class="example">
  {'terminated', <em>Reason</em>}
</pre>
              <p>
                where <code><em>Reason</em></code> is an Erlang term that
                indicates the reason for the termination.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

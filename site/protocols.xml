    <title>Which protocols does RabbitMQ support?</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <p class="intro">
        RabbitMQ supports several messaging protocols, directly and through the
        use of plugins. This page describes the supported protocols and
        helps differentiate between them.
      </p>

      <doc:section>
        <h3>AMQP 0-9-1, 0-9 and 0-8, and extensions</h3>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ was originally developed to <a href="protocol.html">support
          AMQP</a>. As such this protocol is the "core" protocol supported by
          the broker. All of these variants are fairly similar to each other,
          with later versions tidying up unclear or unhelpful parts of earlier
          versions. We have <a href="extensions.html">extended</a> AMQP 0-9-1
          in various ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          AMQP 0-9-1 is a binary protocol, and defines quite strong
          messaging semantics. For clients it's a reasonably easy
          protocol to implement, and as such there
          are <a href="devtools.html">a large number of
          implementations</a> available for many different programming
          languages and environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are just looking to use RabbitMQ, we recommend using AMQP
          0-9-1.
        </p>

        <h3>STOMP</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="http://stomp.github.io/">STOMP</a> is a text-based
          messaging protocol emphasising (protocol) simplicity. It
          defines little in the way of messaging semantics, but is
          easy to implement and very easy to implement partially (it's
          the only protocol that can be used by hand over telnet).
        </p>

        <p>
          RabbitMQ supports STOMP (all current versions) via
          a <a href="stomp.html">plugin</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>MQTT</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> is a binary protocol
          emphasising lightweight publish / subscribe messaging,
          targetted towards clients in constrained devices. It has
          well defined messaging semantics for publish / subscribe,
          but not for other messaging idioms.
        </p>

        <p>
          RabbitMQ supports MQTT 3.1 via a <a href="mqtt.html">plugin</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>AMQP 1.0</h3>
        <p>
          Despite the name, AMQP 1.0 is a radically different protocol from
          AMQP 0-9-1 / 0-9 / 0-8, sharing essentially nothing at the wire
          level. AMQP 1.0 imposes far fewer semantic requirements; it is
          therefore easier to add support for AMQP 1.0 to existing
          brokers. The protocol is substantially more complex than AMQP 0-9-1,
          and there are fewer client implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ supports AMQP 1.0 via a <a href="plugins.html">plugin</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>HTTP</h3>

        <p>
          HTTP is of course not a messaging protocol. However,
          RabbitMQ can transmit messages over HTTP in three ways:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The <a href="management.html">management plugin</a> supports a
            simple HTTP API to send and receive messages. This is primarily
            intended for diagnostic purposes but can be used for low volume
            messaging without <a href="reliability.html">reliable
            delivery</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <a href="web-stomp.html">Web-STOMP plugin</a> supports STOMP
            messaging to the browser, using WebSockets.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <a href="plugins.html">JSON-RPC channel plugin</a> supports
            AMQP 0-9-1 messaging
            over <a href="http://json-rpc.org/">JSON-RPC</a> to the
            browser. Note that since JSON RPC is a synchronous protocol, some
            parts of AMQP that depend on asynchronous delivery to the client
            are emulated by polling.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <title>RabbitMQ - Extensions and Experimental Features</title>
  </head>

      <p class="intro">
        The RabbitMQ Server implements a number of extensions of the
        <a href="specification.html">AMQP specification</a>, which we
        are documenting here.  There are also some experimental
        features, not directly related to the specification, which we
        consider to be useful but require further testing.

        <doc:heading>Unroutable Message Exchanges</doc:heading>
        
        <p>
          It is sometimes desirable to let clients handle messages
          that an exchange was unable to route (i.e. either because
          there were no bound queues our no matching
          bindings). Typical examples of this are
          <ul>
            <li>detecting when clients accidentally or maliciously
            publish messages that cannot be routed</li>
            <li>"or else" routing semantics where some messages are
            handled specially and the rest by a generic handler</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          RabbitMQ's <em>Unroutable Message Exchange</em> ("UME")
          feature addresses these use cases.
        </p>

        <doc:subsection>
          <doc:heading>Configuration</doc:heading>
          <p>
            When creating an exchange the name of a UME can be
            optionally supplied in the <code>exchange.declare</code>
            method's <code>arguments</code> table by specifying a key
            of 'ume' and a value of type 'S' (string) containing the
            name.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a UME has been specified, in addition to the usual
            <em>configure</em> permissions on the declared exchange,
            the user needs to have <em>read</em> permissions on that
            exchange and <em>write</em> permissions on the UME.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; args = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
args.put("ume", "my-ume");
channel.exchangeDeclare("my-direct", "direct", false, false, false, args);
channel.exchangeDeclare("my-ume", "fanout");
channel.queueDeclare("routed");
channel.queueBind("routed", "my-direct", "key1");
channel.queueDeclare("unrouted");
channel.queueBind("unrouted", "my-ume", "");</pre>
          <p>
            In the above fragment of Java code we create a direct
            exchange 'my-direct' that is configured with a UME called
            'my-ume'. The latter is declared as a fanout exchange. We
            bind one queue 'routed' to 'my-direct' with a binding key
            of 'key1', and a queue 'unrouted' to 'my-ume'.
          </p>
        </doc:subsection>

        <doc:subsection>
          <doc:heading>Operation</doc:heading>
          <p>
            Whenever an exchange with a configured UME cannot route a
            message to any queue (or the message was marked as
            immediate and it cannot be delivered to any consumer) then
            it publishes the message to the specified UME instead. If
            that UME does not exist then a warning is logged.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode">
channel.basicPublish("my-direct", "key2", null, "test".getBytes());
GetResponse r2 = channel.basicGet("unrouted", true); //returns message
channel.basicPublish("my-direct", "key1", null, "test".getBytes());
GetResponse r1 = channel.basicGet("routed", true); //returns message</pre>
          <p>
            Here we first publish a message to 'my-direct' with a
            routing key of 'key1'. That message is routed to the
            'routed' queue, in accordance with the standard AMQP
            behaviour.  However, when publishing a message to
            'my-direct' with a routing key of 'key2', rather than
            being discarded the message is routed via our configured
            UME to the 'unrouted' queue.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a UME cannot route a message, it in turn publishes
            the message to its UME, if it has one configured. This
            process continues until either the message is successfully
            routed, the end of the chain of UMEs is reached, or a UME
            is encountered which has already attempted to route the
            message.
          </p>
          <p>
            The semantics of the 'mandatory' and 'immediate' flags
            carries through to UMEs. So, for example, if a sender
            specified the 'mandatory' flag on publication of a
            message, and that message could not be routed by the
            original exchange, but was then routed to a queue via a
            UME, then no <code>basic.return</code> is issued.
          </p>
          <p>
            Message properties are carried through when messages are
            routed via UMEs. For example, when a message that was
            marked as persistent is routed to some queue via a UME
            then it does get persisted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The queues to which a messages is routed from an UME
            participate in AMQP's <code>tx</code> transactions,
            i.e. if an unroutable message was published inside a tx
            then it will only appear in the queues when that tx is
            committed.
          </p>

        <doc:heading>Memory-based flow control</doc:heading>

        <p>
          In versions of the RabbitMQ server prior to version 1.5.x,
          it was possible for clients to attempt to store so many
          messages within the server that it outgrew the available
          memory. With the release of version 1.5.x, an experimental
          memory-pressure-detection feature has been added to the
          codebase, so that when the server notices available memory
          drop below 5% of the total memory available to the system,
          it throttles publishers with the <code>channel.flow</code>
          AMQP command.
        </p>

        <p>
          The feature has been tested and found to work on various
          Linux distributions, and is therefore enabled on those
          platforms by default. Please report back to the <a
          href="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">RabbitMQ
          mailing list</a> your experiences using the feature on your
          platform!
        </p>

        <doc:subsection>
          <doc:heading>Usage</doc:heading>
          <p>
            To enable the feature when running the RabbitMQ on other
            platforms, add
	  </p>

	  <pre class="sourcecode">-rabbit memory_alarms true</pre>

          <p>
            to your <code>RABBITMQ_SERVER_START_ARGS</code>
	    environment variable or to the
	    <code>SERVER_START_ARGS</code> definition in
	    <code>/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf</code>, as appropriate for
	    your platform.
	  </p>

          <p>
            Similarly, to disable the feature add
          </p>

	  <pre class="sourcecode">-rabbit memory_alarms false</pre>

          <p>
            The memory threshold at which the flow control is
            triggered can be adjusted by modifying
            the
            <pre class="sourcecode">-os_mon system_memory_high_watermark 0.95</pre>
            line in the <code>rabbitmq-server</code>
            / <code>rabbitmq-server.bat</code> script.
          </p>

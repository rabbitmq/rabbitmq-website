              broker, which is easy to deploy on cloud environments,
              on-premises, and on your local machine. It is currently used by

                    <p>You have a backend service that needs to send
                      notifications to end users. There are two notification
                      channels: emails and push notifications for the mobile
                      application.</p>
                    <p>The backend publishes the notification to two queues,
                      one for each channel. Programs that manage emails and
                      push notification subscribe to the queue they are
                      interested in and handle notifications as soon as they

                    <p>You own a concert hall. Tickets for the shows are sold
                      on multiple websites and physical kiosks. Orders from all
                      channels must go through a complex process to determine
                      if a customer effectively get their tickets, depending on
                      availability. The website or kiosk expect to get an
                      answer for the order in minimal time.</p>
                    <p>Orders are published to a queue in RabbitMQ with a
                      correlation ID. The caller that pushed the order then
                      subscribes to another queue and waits for an answer with
                      that same correlation ID.</p>
                    <p>To achieve low latency, a <Link to="/docs/classic-queues">classic queue</Link> is
                      a good fit here but it is at the expense of less safety —
                      the caller can still retry. If the order cannot be lost,
                      you might prefer to use a combination of <Link
                      to="/docs/confirms">acknowledgments</Link> and <Link

                      a message is safe once confirmed.</p>
                    <p>This topology allows the processing of orders to be
                      serialized to serve them in a first come first served
                      order. This avoids the need for transactions.</p>

                    <p>The upload service appends “New video” events to a
                      RabbitMQ stream. Multiple backend applications can
                      subscribe to that stream and read new events
                      independently of each other. Users must be notified right
                      away, but the post-upload analysis can wait and run once
                      a day.</p>

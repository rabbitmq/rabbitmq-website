# RabbitMQ Trademark Guidelines

## Purpose

Broadcom, Inc. (“Broadcom”) owns a number of international trademarks and logos
that identify the RabbitMQ community and individual RabbitMQ projects
(“RabbitMQ Marks”). These trademarks include the word and the logos that
follow.

### Word

RabbitMQ

### Logos

This policy outlines Broadcom’s policy and guidelines about the use of the
RabbitMQ trademarks by members of the RabbitMQ development and user community.

## Why Have Trademark Guidelines?

The RabbitMQ Marks are a symbol of the quality and community support associated
with the RabbitMQ open source software. Trademarks protect not only those using
the marks, but the entire community as well. Our community members need to know
that they can rely on the quality and capabilities represented by the brand. We
also want to provide a level playing field. No one should use the RabbitMQ
marks in ways that mislead or take advantage of the community, or make unfair
use of the trademarks. Also, use of the RabbitMQ Marks should not be in a
disparaging manner because we prefer that our marks not be used to be rude
about the RabbitMQ open source project or its members.

## Open Source License vs. Trademarks

The Apache 2.0 license gives you the right to use, copy, distribute and modify
the RabbitMQ software. However, open source licenses like the Apache 2.0
license do not address trademarks. RabbitMQ Marks need to be used in a way
consistent with trademark law, and that is why we have prepared this policy –
to help you understand what branding is allowed or required when using our
software under the Apache license.

## Proper Use of the RabbitMQ Marks

We want to encourage a robust community for the RabbitMQ open source project.
Therefore, you may do any of the following, as long as you do so in a way that
does not devalue, dilute, or disparage the RabbitMQ brand. In other words, when
you do these things, you should behave responsibly and reasonably in the
interest of the community, but you do not need a trademark license from us to
do them.

### Nominative Use

You may engage in “nominative use” of the RabbitMQ name, but this does not
allow you to use the logo. Nominative use is sometimes called “fair use” of a
trademark, and does not require a trademark license from us. Here are examples:

1. You may use the RabbitMQ Marks in connection with development of tools,
   add-ons, or utilities that are compatible with bit-for-bit identical copies
   of official RabbitMQ software. For example, if you are developing a Foobar
   tool for RabbitMQ, acceptable project titles would be “Foobar for RabbitMQ".

2. You may use the RabbitMQ Marks in connection with your noncommercial
   redistribution of (1) bit-for-bit identical copies of official RabbitMQ
   software, and (2) unmodified copies of official RabbitMQ source packages.
   For example, if your Foobar product included a full redistribution of
   official RabbitMQ Software or source code packages: "RabbitMQ-powered Foobar
   Product". We strongly discourage, and likely would consider it a trademark
   problem, to use a name such as “RabbitMQ Foobar.”

3. If you offer maintenance, support, or hosting services for RabbitMQ
   software, you may accurately state that in your marketing materials or
   portfolio, without using the RabbitMQ logo.

4. You may modify the RabbitMQ software and state that your modified software
   is “based on the RabbitMQ software” or a similar accurate statement, without
   using the RabbitMQ logo.

5. You may engage in community advocacy. The RabbitMQ software is developed by
   and for its community. We will allow the use of the word trademark in this
   context, provided:

    1. The trademark is used in a manner consistent with this policy
    2. There is no commercial purpose behind the use
    3. There is no suggestion that your project is approved, sponsored, or
       affiliated with Broadcom.
    4. User or Development Groups. You may create RabbitMQ user or development
       groups, and publicize meetings or discussions for those groups. Please
       consider joining our official group.

### Attribution

Identify the trademarks as trademarks of Broadcom, as set forth in [Section
6](#proper-notice-and-attribution).

### Redistribution of Binaries

If you redistribute binaries that you have downloaded from the RabbitMQ
repository, you should retain the logos and name of the product. However, if
you make any changes to the binaries (other than configuration or installation
changes that do not involve changes to the source code), or if you re-build
binaries from our source code, you should not use our logos. Our logos
represent our quality control, so they should be retained where the product has
been built by us, but not otherwise. Our source code does not include logo
image files, to remind you to follow this rule.

### Capitalization

“RabbitMQ” should always be capitalized and one words.

### Adjectives

Use the RabbitMQ mark as an adjective, not a noun or verb.

## Improper Use of the Trademarks and Logos

Use of the logos is reserved solely for use by Broadcom in its unaltered form.
Examples of unauthorized use of the RabbitMQ trademarks include:

### Commercial Use

You may not use the RabbitMQ Marks in connection with commercial redistribution
of RabbitMQ software (commercial redistribution includes, but is not limited
to, redistribution in connection with any commercial business activities or
revenue-generating business activities) regardless of whether the RabbitMQ
software is unmodified.

### Entity Names

You may not form a company, use a company name, or create a software product
name that includes the “RabbitMQ” trademark, or implies any foundational or
authorship role. If you have a software product that works with RabbitMQ, it is
suggested you use terms such as ‘&lt;product name> for RabbitMQ’ or
‘&lt;product name>, RabbitMQ Edition.” If you wish to form an entity for a user
or developer group, please contact us and we will be glad to discuss a license
for a suitable name.

### Class or Quality

You may not imply that you are providing a class or quality of RabbitMQ (e.g.,
"enterprise-class" or "commercial quality") in a way that implies RabbitMQ is
not of that class, grade or quality, nor that other parties are not of that
class, grade, or quality.

### Combinations

Use of the RabbitMQ Marks to identify software that combines any portion of the
RabbitMQ software with any other software, unless the combined distribution is
an official RabbitMQ distribution. For example, you may not distribute a
combination of the RabbitMQ software with software released by the Foobar
project under the name “RabbitMQ Foobar Distro”.

### False or Misleading Statements

You may not make false or misleading statements regarding your use of RabbitMQ
(e.g., "we wrote the majority of the code" or "we are major contributors" or
"we are committers").

### Domain Names

You must not use RabbitMQ or any confusingly similar phrase in a domain name.
For instance `www.rabbitmqhost.com` is not allowed. If you wish to use such a
domain name for a non-commercial user or developer group to engage in community
advocacy, please contact us and we will be glad to discuss a license for a
suitable domain name. Because of the many persons who, unfortunately, seek to
spoof, swindle or deceive the community by using confusing domain names, we
must be very strict about this rule.

### Merchandise

You must not manufacture, sell or give away merchandise items, such as T-shirts
and mugs, bearing the RabbitMQ logo, or create any mascot for the project. If
you wish to use the logo to do this for a non-commerical user or developer
group to engage in community advocacy, please contact us and we will be glad to
discuss a license to do this.

### Variations, takeoffs or abbreviations

You may not use a variation of the RabbitMQ name or logo for any purpose other
than common usage of these in community communications. For example, the
following are not acceptable:

* RMQ
* MyRabbitMQ
* RabbitMQ Messaging
* RabbitMQ Guru

### Endorsement or Sponsorship

You may not use the RabbitMQ trademarks in a manner that would imply Broadcom’s
affiliation with or endorsement, sponsorship, or support of a product or
service.

### Rebranding

You may not change the trademark on unmodified RabbitMQ software to your own
brand. You may not hold yourself out as the source of the RabbitMQ software,
except to the extent you have modified it as allowed under the Apache 2.0
license, and you make it clear that you are the source only of the
modification.

### Combination Marks

Do not use our trademarks in combination with any other marks or logos (for
example Foobar RabbitMQ, or the name of your company or product typeset to look
like the RabbitMQ logo).

### Web Tags

Do not use the RabbitMQ trademark in a title or metatag of a web page to
influence search engine rankings or result listings, rather than for discussion
or advocacy of the RabbitMQ project.

## Proper Notice and Attribution

The appropriate trademark symbol (i.e., ®) should appear at least with the
first use of the RabbitMQ trademarks (for example, RabbitMQ®). When you use a
RabbitMQ trademark you should include a statement attributing the trademark to
Broadcom. For example, "RabbitMQ is a trademark of Broadcom, Inc. in the U.S.
and other countries."

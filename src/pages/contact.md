# Getting Help and Support

## Open Source Edition and Community Support Policy

Effective June 1st 2024, the RabbitMQ team will adopt a new [community support and release policy](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/COMMUNITY_SUPPORT.md) for the open source distribution.

The changes do not impact the current RabbitMQ open source license. The RabbitMQ core team continues developing
open source RabbitMQ under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 [on GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq).

With the new policy, older open source release series (for example, RabbitMQ 3.12.x) will no longer receive
updates (patch releases). Patch releases for older series of both the open source and commercial editions
will be available to customers that have [VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ commercial licenses](#paid-support)


## Overview {#overview}

There are two primary ways to obtain RabbitMQ support from the core development team at Broadcom:

 * [Paid commercial support](#paid-support)
 * For [users who run the latest series](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/COMMUNITY_SUPPORT.md),
   several [community resources](#community-resources) are available


## Paid Commercial Support {#paid-support}

### Enquiries

To buy a commercial license, contact Broadcom sales at [contact-tanzu-data.pdl@broadcom.com](mailto:contact-tanzu-data.pdl@broadcom.com).

To learn about the commercial support options, see [VMware's Commercial Open Source RabbitMQ support](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq/oss).

version of RabbitMQ, go to the [VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ product page](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq).

### Existing Commercial Users

Customers with a commercial license for RabbitMQ are entitled to support for both the OSS and Commercial product distributions.

Customer questions and issues related to either the OSS or the Commercial distributions
must be opened through the [Broadcom Support Portal](https://support.broadcom.com/).

is [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/discussions).

The list offers a free, best effort support from the community and the RabbitMQ core team.

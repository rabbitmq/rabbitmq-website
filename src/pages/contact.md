# Getting Help and Support

## Open Source Edition and Community Support Policy

Effective June 1st 2024, the RabbitMQ team will adopt a new [community support and release policy](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/COMMUNITY_SUPPORT.md) for the open source distribution.

The changes do not impact the current RabbitMQ open source license. The RabbitMQ core team continues developing
open source RabbitMQ under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 [on GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq).

With the new policy, older open source release series (for example, RabbitMQ 3.12.x) will no longer receive
updates (patch releases). Patch releases for older series of both the open source and commercial editions
will be available to customers that have [VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ commercial licenses](#paid-support)


## Overview {#overview}

There are two primary ways to obtain RabbitMQ support from the core development team at Broadcom:

 * [Paid commercial support](#paid-support)
 * For [users who run the latest series](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/COMMUNITY_SUPPORT.md),
   a number [community resources](#community-resources) is available


## Paid Commercial Support {#paid-support}

[this page](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq/oss) for more information and a
contact form. For information about VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ, the Enterprise
version of RabbitMQ, go to the [VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ product page](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq).

If you already have a license with Broadcom for one or the other (that is Open
Source RabbitMQ or an Enterprise version of RabbitMQ) and you need to file a
support ticket, you can do it using the [Customer Portal for VMware
products](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/home). Refer to the [VMware

# Clients Libraries and Developer Tools

## Overview {#overview}

RabbitMQ is [officially supported](/docs/platforms) on a number of
operating systems and has several official client libraries. In addition, the RabbitMQ community
has created numerous clients, adaptors and tools that we list here for
your convenience.

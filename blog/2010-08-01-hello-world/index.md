And welcome to the all-new RabbitMQ blog!

<!-- truncate -->

As you may know, RabbitMQ was recently acquired by [SpringSource](http://www.springsource.com/), a division of [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/).  Prior to that, the RabbitMQ developers worked at [LShift](http://www.lshift.net), and we used to write on the LShift blog.  You can still read [the old RabbitMQ posts there](http://www.lshift.net/blog/category/lshift-sw/rabbitmq).

But now it's time for the RabbitMQ team to have its own blog. We have lots to write about: RabbitMQ itself, and new features as they appear; our more experimental projects; and what's going on in the RabbitMQ community and the world of messaging in general.  The first real post will follow shortly.

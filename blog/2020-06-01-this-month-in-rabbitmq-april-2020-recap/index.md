### A Webinar on Quorum Queues

Before we start with RabbitMQ project and community updates from April,
we have a webinar to announce! Jack Vanlightly, a RabbitMQ core team member,
will present on [High Availability and Data Safety in Messaging](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/14891/412069)
on June 11th, 2020.

In this webinar, Jack Vanlightly will explain [quorum queues](/docs/quorum-queues),
a new replicated queue type in RabbitMQ. Quorum queues were introduced in RabbitMQ 3.8 with a focus on data safety
and efficient, predictable recovery from node failures.
Jack will cover and contrast the design of quorum and classic mirrored queues.

After this webinar, you'll understand:

 * Why quorum queues offer better data safety than mirrored queues
 * How and why server resource usage changes when switching to quorum queues from mirrored queues
 * Some best practices when using quorum queues

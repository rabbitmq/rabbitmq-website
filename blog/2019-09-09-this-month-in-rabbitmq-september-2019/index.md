Welcome back for another edition of This Month in RabbitMQ! Exciting news is that the [first release candidate for RabbitMQ 3.8](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0-rc.1) is now available!

Be sure to catch up on what is new in 3.8 by reading the release notes and watching this [webinar replay](https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/may-23-what-s-new-in-rabbitmq-3-8-webinar?utm_campaign=rabbitmq-blog-3.8-webinar-q319&amp;utm_source=rabbitmq&amp;utm_medium=website).

We are starting to countdown until [RabbitMQ Summit](https://rabbitmqsummit.com/) in London on November 4.
The RabbitMQ team is looking forward to sharing updates on the project,
but we’re also looking forward to hearing from end-users like Bloomberg, WeWork, Softonic, and Zalando.
Be sure to register and snag a spot in one of the training add-on courses.

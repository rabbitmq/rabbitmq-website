Today we launched a RabbitMQ service on [CloudFoundry.com](http://cloudfoundry.com/). This service brings the messaging functionality  of RabbitMQ to developers building applications on Cloud Foundry. You can read [the main announcement](http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/8713844574/rabbitmq-cloud-foundry-cloud-messaging-that-just-works) over on the Cloud Foundry blog. There's also [an FAQ with more details](http://support.cloudfoundry.com/entries/20334618-rabbitmq-service-faq) on the Cloud Foundry knowledge base.  CloudFoundry.com is a free beta service.  So please register there (if you haven't already), then take a look at the RabbitMQ service, try out the sample apps, and write your own.  And tell us how to make it better.

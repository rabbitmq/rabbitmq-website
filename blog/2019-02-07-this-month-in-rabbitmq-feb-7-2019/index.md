Welcome back for another issue of This Month in RabbitMQ. Hopefully you are finding this new series helpful to keep up with the latest project updates and community topics. As we look across the different articles published throughout the month, it’s clear that it truly has a polyglot community. From Spring and .NET, to Ruby and Node.js, there are active users of RabbitMQ out there writing in many different languages. It’s a polyglot world, and we’re connecting it all together!

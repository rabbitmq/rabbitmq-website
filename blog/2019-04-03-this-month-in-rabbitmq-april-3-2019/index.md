RabbitMQ 3.8 is coming! If you haven’t already played with the beta ([version 3](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0-beta.3) is now available), it’s time to start familiarizing yourself with what’s coming. Karl Nilsson and I will present on a webinar in May to walk through what’s new, so please [register](https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/may-23-what-s-new-in-rabbitmq-3-8-webinar?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=rabbitmq-3.8-what's-new&amp;utm_term=q219) and attend.

We are also starting to look forward to the next [RabbitMQ Summit,](https://rabbitmqsummit.com/) once again in London this coming November. The [call for talks is open until May 10](https://eventil.com/events/rabbitmq-summit-2019/cfp), so please consider sharing how you are using RabbitMQ or something you have tried and learned and want to share with the community.

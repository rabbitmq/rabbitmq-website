We intend to release RabbitMQ 3.9.0 on 26 July 2021. While we have been testing
it internally for months, with production-like workloads, we need your help to
check that it is as stable and reliable as we believe it is.

This is the
timeline that we have to work together on making 3.9.0 the best release for
you:

The above release calendar is a point-in-time snapshot. For latest updates
please refer to the [Release Series](/docs/versions)
page.

We are trying something new for RabbitMQ 3.9.0 release, which introduces a
highly-anticipated feature: [Streams](/docs/streams).
This new release calendar is meant to communicate what to expect, and when.
Based on your feedback during the pre-release timeline, we may add additional
release candidates, and extend the release timeline.

Our intention is to give you the opportunity to find issues with this release
before we publish the final version. We all want important new releases, such
as 3.9.0, to be as stable and reliable as possible. While we have gone to great
lengths to ensure that this is the case, more eyes and experiments will always
help, especially with a community as experienced and battle-hardened as ours.

At the time of publishing, we intend to ship RabbitMQ 3.9.0.rc-1 on Monday 12 July
2021, just in time for [RabbitMQ Summit 2021](https://rabbitmqsummit.com/).

**Help us make RabbitMQ 3.9.0 the best release for you!**

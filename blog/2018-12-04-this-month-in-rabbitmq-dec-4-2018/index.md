Hello RabbitMQ friends! Welcome to the first installment of This Month in RabbitMQ, inspired by the wonderful and industrious [Josh Long](https://twitter.com/starbuxman), who publishes monthly and weekly recaps for the Spring community.
Our team was also inspired by the first ever RabbitMQ Summit that we held on November 12 in London.
It was awesome to see an assembly of the community and the knowledge shared. Look out for videos from that event in a future issue of This Month in RabbitMQ.

Without further ado, let's take a look at a roundup of what happened in RabbitMQ land last month!

RabbitMQ is not affected by the Log4j vulnerability, read below for more details.

<!-- truncate -->

RabbitMQ is an Erlang application and as such runs on the BEAM virtual machine, which is not the Java virtual machine.

We **do not** ship Log4j in the RabbitMQ broker.

Our Java libraries (Java client, JMS client, etc) depend on a log fa√ßade (SLF4J), and application developers choose a "binding" - an implementation of a logging library - to use in their applications. Log4j is one of those possible bindings application developers might choose.

We do ship with a log binding for our utility programs, e.g. PerfTest, and the binding we use is Logback, which is not affected.

_Please check in your application code (if Java) and take remedial action there if your developers are using Log4J._

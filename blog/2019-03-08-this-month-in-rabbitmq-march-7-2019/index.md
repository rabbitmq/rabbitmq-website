Welcome back for another issue of This Month in RabbitMQ. Did you know that [RabbitMQ was the seventh highest paying tech skill in 2018](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-paying-programming-languages-skills-here-are-the-top-earners/)? AND, that average pay grew a healthy 5.3% since 2017. It’s no wonder that we keep seeing more folks in the community sharing how they are getting started—or getting better—with RabbitMQ. In that spirit, read on for the latest project updates, community writings, and upcoming trainings!

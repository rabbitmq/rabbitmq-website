All of a sudden there's just one week to go until the [PubSub huddle](http://www.pubsubhuddle.com/). It's a one day conference, in London, about messaging. Not just RabbitMQ, but ZeroMQ, MQTT, XMPP and PuSH.

**It's free as in beer**. *There's free beer*. And, at last count, there's [spaces left](http://skillsmatter.com/event/nosql/pubsub).

### We have some neat talks lined up

* Martin Sustrik -- **The Future of Messaging**
* Andy Piper -- **Introducing MQTT**
* Marek Majkowski -- **Realtime web: Not there yet!**
* Julien Genestoux -- **PubSub for the web : PubSubHubbub, XMPP and Superfeedr**

([full descriptions](http://pubsubhuddle.com/node/1))

If you can't come along, do not fret. The talks will all be taped.

If you can come along, here's the important bit: **we want you to bring along your own projects** (and laptops). Because in the afternoon, we'll be asking for people to stand up and give a quick talk about what they are doing with messaging, then we'll all break out into huddles. This is your chance to win people to your cause -- or to find a great project to get involved in.

We'll have the speakers and various RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ folk floating around, so it's also your chance to put them on the spot.

### pubsubwhatnow?

Going back a few years, James Governor suggested there was an emerging community
of people who cared about messaging and that we should all meet up.  Thus
was born an occasional series of events called "PubSub - putting the pub back into
pubsub". Many people you'll see at the huddle went to those pubs.

The idea of a conference came during the ZeroMQ meetup in Brussels,
when someone said "wouldn't it be great to bring *messaging* folks together for a day?" -- RabbitMQ or ZeroMQ, we think messaging is fundamental.

To make it happen, we partnered with [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/), who know a thing or two about running this kind of event.

### You said free beer?

Yes. We're providing coffee and tea, lunch, and later on beer and pizza, courtesy of VMware. [Register for your free beer and conference here](http://skillsmatter.com/event/nosql/pubsub).
